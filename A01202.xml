            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>MY DEARE READER, I beſeeche thee to reade this Preface for thy ſatisfaction and myne.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Paynim hiſtorians report of a mayden called Glycera, greatly delighted in making of noſegayes, who could ſo fitly and properly varie and chaunge the diſpoſition and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling of the ſweet flowers in her poſies, that with the ſelf ſame flowers, she would frame manie diuers kinds of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſegayes; in ſo much that the painter Pauſias came short of his cunning, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing as it were by emulation to expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe the varietie of her flower-workes, for he could not chaunge his colours into ſo many fashions in his pictures, but Gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera would find more by a new maner of placing of her flowers in her noſegaies. Euen ſo doth the holy Ghoſt diſpoſe and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:5901:7"/> order with enterchaungeable varietie the instructions of deuotion which he geueth by the tongues and pennes of his ſeruaunts; that the doctrine which they teache being one, and the ſelf ſame: the diſcourſe notwithſtanding which they make, and in which they deliuer his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine do much differre, according to the diuerſitie of methods, &amp; fashions (that I may ſo ſay) in which they be couched and compoſed. I cannot therfore, neither ought I, or would I, in any ſort write in this introduction, any thing but that, which hath been alreadie published by our learned predeceſſours concerning this matter; they be the ſelf ſame flowers that I preſent vnto thee (gentle reader) which diuers before me haue offered vnto thy view but the noſegay which I haue framed of them, is of a different fashion from theirs, as being handled in another forme, and wrought after another manner.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:5901:7"/>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe that haue treated of deuotion before me, haue allmost all attended onely to the instruction of perſons all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together retired from worldly conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or at the leaſt haue taught a forme of deuotion, which properly and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally directeth and tendeth to that retired ſtate of life. But my intention is particularly and principally to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct ſuch as liue in cities and townes, buſied with the affaires of their houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, or forced by their place and calling to folow their princes court; ſuch as by the obligation of their eſtate, are bound to take a common courſe of life in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shew, and exteriour proceeding; vvhich kind of perſons for the moſt part of them, vnder colour of a ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, or pretended impoſsibilitie, will not ſo much as once thinke vpon the vndertaking of a deuout life: perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them ſelues, that as no beaſt (yf we may beleeue the naturaliſts) dare

To theſe men do I demonſtrate: that as the mother pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les doe liue in the ſea, not taking one drop of ſalt-water into their shelles; &amp; towards the Chelidonian Iſlands there be fountaines of ſweet water in the middeſt of the brackish ſea; and a ſmall kind of flie called Pycauſtes borne and bred in hot burning ouens and furnaces, flies in the flames without ſcorching her wings: ſo a vigourous and conſtant hart may liue in the world, and yet not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of the vaine humours of the world; may find out fresh ſprings of ſweete deuotion, in the midſt of the brinish waters of temporall affaires; &amp; may flie without harme among the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of earthly occupations, and yet not burne nor ſeare the wings of holy deſires
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:5901:8"/> which lifte vp a deuout ſoule to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, although the bodie neceſſarily, tread vpon earthen mould. True it is in deed, that this is a thing of ſome difficultie: but therfore would I deſire that many men would employ their cares in the attaining of ſo high à thing with more zeale then ordinarilie they doe, and they should find it not ſo vneaſie as they imagine it. My ſelf, weak and feeble as I am, haue endeuoured by this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tribute ſomething of mine owne coſt, toward the helping of ſuch, as with a noble hart will vndertake this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yet notwithſtanding this preſent deſire of mine, it was neither by mine owne choice nor liking, that this intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came to the publique vew of the world. A certaine frind of mine, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed indeed with true honour and virtue, hauing ſome good while recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the grace of God, to aſpire vnto a

Since which time he communicated them, vnto a great, learned, &amp; deuout perſon, who eſteeming them ſo profitable that many other might reape commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by them, did earneſtly exhort me to publishe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and eaſie was it for him to perſuade me, becauſe his loue had great power ouer my will, &amp; his iudgement
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:5901:9"/> had great authoritie ouer mine.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Wherfore, that it might be more acceptable, I haue tooke a review of it, enterlacing many things in diuers places, and adioyning ſome aduices and inſtructions, fit for the purpoſe which before I ſayd that I entend: and all this haue I done, hauing all moſt no leaſure at all to ſpare. For which cauſe look here for no exact or curious diſcources: but onely a plaine heape of good aduertiſments, ſimplie and nakedly ſet downe and declared in eaſie and intelligible woords: at leaſt wiſe I deſired ſo to doe. As for the adorning of the ſtile and language, I could not ſo much as think of it, as hauing other things enough to doe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. All my words throughout the book are addreſſed to Philotheus. For my intention being to reduce to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good many ſoules, that which I
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:5901:10"/> had firſt writt for one onely: I think I may fitly vſe that name which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to all ſuch which wil be deuout and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in gods ſeruice: for Philotheus is as much to ſay as a louer of God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Therfore in all the treatiſe, laying before my conſideration a ſoule which by exerciſe of deuotion aſpireth to the loue of God: I haue deuided this intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction into fiue parts. In the firſt, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour by perſuaſions and peculiar exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cizes, to allure and winne the wille of my Philotheus, to an entire and fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me reſolution of liuing well: which he maketh at length after a generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, with a round and ſound prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, ſeconded by the receauing of the holy communion, in which giuing vp his ſoule vnto his ſauiour, he receaues his ſauiour into his ſoule, and ſo entreth happelie into the retreat and cloſet of his heauenly loue, That done, to lead him farther on, I shew him two ſpeciall
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:5901:10"/> meanes how to vnite him ſelf more &amp; more euery day vnto his diuine maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie: the one, the vſe of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, by which our good God commeth vnto vs: the other, the exercize of holy prayer, wherby he draweth vs vnto him ſelf: and in this I ſpend the ſecond part. In the third, I ſet before his eyes, how he may exerciſe him ſelfe in ſuch virtues as be fit and conuenient for his profit &amp; aduancement: in which yet I onely bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie my penne, in laying together ſome particular aduices which I thought he could hardly haue had of another, or found out of him ſelf. In the fourth part, I diſcouer the embushments and lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king dennes of his enemies, shewing him how he may eſcape their ſnares, &amp; deliuer him ſelf fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their enticeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, that ſo he may goe forward without hindraunce in his worthie enterprize. In the fift and last part, I teach him to with draw him ſelf as it were from
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:5901:11"/> other ordinarie exerciſes to the cabinet of his ſoule, to refreshe his weerie deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and renew his holy purpoſes, taking breath as it were, and repairing his forces, that he may afterward cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageouſly get ground &amp; aduaunce him ſelf in his iourney to perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Well do I ſee in this curious age of ours, that many will ſay, it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to religious votaries, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the particular guidaunce of ſoules, vnto this ſingular exerciſe of pietie, which requireth more leaſure then a Bishop can well ſpare, charged with a dioceſe ſo heauie as mine is; that theſe deuout instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s too much diſtract the vnderſtanding, which should be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied in affairs of greater importaunce. But as for me, to ſpeak what I thinck, I ſay (deere reader) with great S. Denis that it appertaineth principally to Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops to conduct the ſoules committed to their charge vnto perfection: ſince their
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:5901:11"/> ranck and order is ſupreme among men, as is the order of Seraphins among the quyres of Angels; ſo that their leaſure cannot be better ſpent, then about ſuch buſines. The auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Bishops &amp; fathers of the church were at the leaſt as much affectioned to their charge, as wee: yet letted they not for all that to vndertake the particular care of guiding many ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, which ſingulary had recourſe vnto their aſsiſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as it appeareth by their epiſtles. And heerin they imitated the Apoſtles them ſelues, who in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the generall haruest of all the world, gathered notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding many times with peculiar care and affection, certaine notable ſcattered eares of corne; not onely contented to tye the vvhole sheafs of wheat, but alſo not diſdaining euen to gleane, as they ſay, where they perceiued any remarkable ſoule, that in particular offered it ſelf to their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>are. Who knovveth not that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:5901:12"/> Timotheus, Philemon, Oneſimus, Thecla, and Appia were the deare children of the great S. Paule? as S. Marck and S. Petronilla of S. Peter? S. Petronilla I ſay, who (as Baronius learnedly proueth, Gallonius folowing him) was not the naturall daughter, but onely the ghostly child of S. Peter. And S. Iohn the beloued diſciple of our Lord, writeth he not one of his cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall epiſtles vnto a deuout Ladie, whome for her pietie he calleth <hi>electa,</hi> the elect, and choſen ladie?</p>
            <p n="8">8. It is a painfull charge I confeſſe, to take the particular care of ſoules, and conduct them in ſuch ſingular manner in the way of perfection; but as painfull as it is, it bringeth withall exceſsiue comfort: much like vnto the painfull toile of thriftie husbandmen in time of harueſt and vintage, who are neuer more merry, then when their hands are moſt full of ſuch labours. It is a
<pb facs="tcp:5901:12"/> burden which recreateth and reuiueth the hart of him that is loaden with it, through the abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of delight which floweth from it: as the bundles of Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namom vvith ſweet and recreatiue odour comforteth thoſe that carie them through the boiling ſands of Arabia. They report of the Tygre, that hauing recouered one of her whelpes (which the craftie huntſ-man leaueth in the way, to buſie her with all while he caries away the reſt of the litter) she taketh it vp preſently be it neuer ſo great, and finds her ſelf neuer a whit the heauier or ſlower, but rather lighter and ſwifter in her courſe, naturall loue as it were lightening her with her very loade. How much more willingly then will a fatherly hart take vpon him the charge of a ſoule, which he finds all melting with deſire of holy perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? vvhy should he not moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully bear ſuch a ſoule in his boſom (as I
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:5901:13"/> may ſay) like as a louing mother doth her litle child, being neuer weary of cariyng the burthen which she loueth ſo entirely? But it muſt be indeed a fatherly hart that vndertakes ſo toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome a taske: and for that cauſe the Apoſtles and Apoſtolique men, doe call their diſciples not only their children, but with a terme of more tender affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, their litle children.</p>
            <p n="9">9. To conclude (gentle reader) I confeſſe that I write of deuotion, being my ſelf without deuotion, yet truly not without an earneſt deſire of attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therunto. And this very deſire is that which hath giuen me courage to vndertake to inſtruct thee in the way to deuotion. For, as a great learned man ſayd, it is a good meanes to become laarned, for a man to ſtudie hard: a better, to heare a learned maiſter: but the beſt of all to teach another. And it often commeth to paſſe (ſaith S. Aug.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:5901:13"/> writing to his deuout Florentin) <hi>that the office of diſtributing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſerueth vs as a merit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the ſame things our ſelues: and the office of teaching, beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes a foundation of learning.</hi> The great Alexander, cauſed his louely Compaspe to be pictured by the pencill of the famous Appelles: who forced by often reflexion to contemplate wishfully Compaspes perfection, as he drew the lineaments of her faire bodie vpon his table, ſo imprinted he withall the loue of her beautie in his hart, and became ſo paſsionatly enamoured of her, that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander perceauing it, &amp; pitiyng his caſe, gaue him her in marriage, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him ſelf for his ſake, of the deareſt loue he had: shewing heerin (as Plinie iudgeth) the greatnes of his hart more plainly, then by any bloudie victory ouer a puiſſant enemie. I perſuade my ſelf that it is the will of God, that I should
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:5901:14"/> procure in the beſt colours that I am able, to paint the formes of beautifull virtues vpon the harts of thoſe which are committed to my charge, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the beautifull virtue of Deuotion, moſt amiable and acceptable in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine eyes. And I vndertake the office willingly, as well to obey, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme my duty, as for the hope I haue, that engrauing this louely virtue in the minds of other men, mine owne perhaps may wholly be enamoured of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes therof. And I doubt not, but yf euer his diuine maieſtie perceaue my ſoule ſincerely in loue with this beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull virtue, he will beſtowe her vpon me, in a happie marriage for euer. The faire and chaſt Rebecca watring Iſaaks camels with a readie good will, was preſently choſen to be his eſpouſe, recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing out of hand in his name, pretious earings and golden braceletts, as pledges of his loue. So doe I perſuade my ſelf,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:5901:14"/> through the boundleſſe goodnes of my God, that carefully leading his beloued sheep to the wholſome waters of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he will make my poore ſoule his ſpouſe, fastening in my eares the golden words of his holy loue, and binding on my wrists, force and vigour to practize them, in which conſiſteth the eſſence of true deuotion; which I humblie beſeech his heauenly maieſtie to beſtow vpon me, and vpon all the obedient children of his holy church. To whoſe decrees &amp; correction I do, and will, allway ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt my writings, my actions, my words, my wills, and my thoughts. At Necy, on S. Mary Magdalens day, 1609.</p>

True and liuely deuotion (my Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotheus) preſuppoſeth in our harts the loue of God: nay rather it is nothing els but a certain perfect and high degree of the true loue of God: for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the loue of God, as the thing that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth our ſoules, and maketh them louely in the eyes of his maieſtie, then do we call it heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly grace: and becauſe this ſelf ſame loue of God, yf it be true and vnfained loue, giueth vs ſtrength &amp; force to do good workes, it is called charity: but when it growes to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that it not only ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth vs to do well, but alſo vrgeth vs vehemently to do good works dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, frequently, and feruently, then is it properly called deuotion. Auſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches becauſe of their monſtrous wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghte, neuer flie in the ayre, but only run vpon the ground by help of their wings: Hennes flie ſometimes in the ayre, but very ſeldom, and then alſo low and ſlowlie: but doues, &amp; eagles ſoare aloft in the skies, with ſpeedines, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to ſee them ſelues farre from the ground, and nigh to the element: In like maner ſinfull men, loaden with
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:5901:18"/> the burden of offences, flie not at all to God-ward, but make al their courſes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, and for earthly delights: Good honeſt men, that endeuour to abſtaine from mortall ſinnes, but are not yet arriued to the hight of deuotion, flie to God with their actions and good deeds, but ſlowlie, and rarely, and in ordinarie things, as being hindred with the waight of their imperfections, and heauie winged thoughts fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> higher ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes. But deuout ſoules flie to God with ſwifte &amp; nimble wings of holy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, readilie, and feruourouſly, ſoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring &amp; mounting higher and higher to the heauen of perfection. Briefly, deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is nothing els but a ſpirituall ſwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ftnes and nimblenes of loue, by which charitie worketh our actions in vs, or we by her, with readines of will, and alacritie of mind; And as it is the office of charitie, in what degree ſoeuer it be, to make vs keep the commandements of God generally and vniuerſally: ſo is it the proper function of deuotion, to fullfill the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts with prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptnes, feruour, and nimble vigour of our minds, as it were delighting, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:5901:18"/> reioycing in doing our dutie towards, God &amp; man. Hence it is, that he which keepeth not the commandements of God, can neither be eſteemed good, nor deuout: ſince to be good, he muſt be indued with charitie; and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout, it is not enough to haue any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of charitie whatſoeuer, but beſides he muſt haue a quick and readie affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and habit of exerciſing the higheſt and perfecteſt actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of charitie: which readines of mind, is the true virtue of deuotion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Deuotion then conſiſteth in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine degree of excellent charitie, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vs prompt and readie, not onely in the keeping of Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but beſides that, it prouoketh vs to doe with ioy and delight all maner of good works, although they be not in any ſort commanded by Gods law, but onely commended vnto our free-will by his counſells and holy inſpirations. For like as a man but newly recouered from a long and daungerous ſicknes, walketh now and then as much as is neceſſarie for his health, but yet ſlowly and leaſurely for want of ſtrength and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:5901:19"/> vigour: ſo a ſinner but lately reclaimed from the diſeaſes of iniquitie, walketh in the way of Gods commandements, but yet ſlowly, and faintly, no more then is neceſſarie for his ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vntill ſuch time as he gaine the ſtrength of deuotion, for then like a man in ſound &amp; perfect health, he not onely walketh luſtely and cheerfully in the high way of Gods commandements, but with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding courage, and earneſt deſire of pleaſing his Sauiour, runneth ſpeedely, as it were leaping &amp; dancing for ioy and exaltatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mind, in the pathes of Gods councels and heauenly inſpirations. To conclude, charitie and deuotion doe differ one from another, no more then fire from flame: for charitie is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall fire which God kindleth in our harts, and when it breaketh out in to flames, then is it called deuotion: So that deuotion addeth nothing to the fire of charitie, ſauing a bright flame of redines and promptnes of mind to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe actiuely, ſpeedily, with out delayes, or difficulties, at all occaſions, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, and works of his councells, and inſpirations, which it

It ſerueth for fire in the winter of aduerſitie, and for mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning dew in the ſummer of proſperitie.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:5901:21"/> Deuotion knowes how to abound in plentie, and how to be patient in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie: deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maketh equall eſteeme of honour and diſgrace, and receaueth pleaſure and paine, almoſt, with one and the ſame vnchaungeable mind; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally filleth our ſoules brim-full of ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable delights.</p>

               <p n="1">1. GOD commaunded the plants in their creation, to beare frute, euery one according to his kind: euen ſo commandeth he all Chriſtians, (who are the liuing plants of his Church) to fructifie and bring foorth the workes of deuotion, euery one according to his kinde and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. For deuotion ought to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed differently by the gentleman, by the artificer, by the ſeruant, by the Prince, by the widdow, by the maid, and by the married. And the practiſe of deuotion is not onely diuers in diuers
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:5901:22"/> eſtates, but euen in the ſelf ſame eſtate muſt it be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modated, to the forces, affaires, leaſure, and dutie of euery one in particular. For I pray thee, would it doe well yf the Bishop should be ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie like the Carthuſian? or the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried man should lay vp no more in ſtore for the maintenance of his familie, then the Capuchin? or that the Artificer should be all day in the church like the monk: and the monke buſie him ſelf in all kindes of occurrents, for the ſeruice of his neighbour, as doth the Biſhop? Were not ſuch deuotion ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, diſorderly, and intolerable? And yet is this prepoſterous manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding now a dayes moſt vſuall: and the world either not able, or not willing to diſcerne deuotion, from indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, murmureth &amp; blameth deuotion, which not-withſtanding, can nether helpe, nor redreſſe theſe diſorders.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No (my Philotheus) true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion neuer marreth any thing, but rather maketh and perfecteth: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion that is contrarie to the lawfull calling of any man, is vndoubtedly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and falſe deuotion. The Bee (ſaith
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:5901:23"/> the philoſopher) ſucketh hony from hearbes and flowers without hurting or endamageing them, but leauing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as whole &amp; as freshe as she found them: but true deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth more then ſo: for it not onely hurteth no ſtate, vocation or affaire, but contrariwiſe bettereth &amp; adorneth it. All kind of pearles and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes being ſteeped in hony, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more glittering, euery one after its natiue colour: and ſo euery chriſtian becommeth more perfect, &amp; excellent in his vocation, ioyning the ſame with true deuotion: the care of familie by it is made more quiet and peaceable; the loue of man and wife more ſincere and durable; the ſeruice of ſubiects to their prince more loyal and acceptable; and all kind of occupations become more eaſie and tolerable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It were an errour, nay an hereſie, to go about to banishe deuotion from the companies of ſoldiours, out of the shops of artificers, the courts of princes, and from the houshold or familie of maried folk. True it is, that the deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, altogether contemplatiue, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſticall, and religious, cannot be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:5901:23"/> in theſe vocations: yet are there many other degrees and exerciſes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, which ſufficiently and eaſilie lead ſecular perſons to perfection; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iſaak, Iacob, Dauid, Iob, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bias, Sara, Rebecca, and Iudith, are witneſſes heerof in the ancient law: and as touching the new, <hi>S.</hi> Ioſeph, <hi>S.</hi> Lydia, and <hi>S.</hi> Criſpin, were perfectly deuout in their open shops; <hi>S.</hi> Anne, <hi>S.</hi> Martha, <hi>S.</hi> Monica, amonghſt their families: <hi>S.</hi> Cornelius, <hi>S.</hi> Sebaſtian, <hi>S.</hi> Maurice, amidſt the armies: and Conſtantin, <hi>S.</hi> Helen, <hi>S.</hi> Lewis, <hi>S.</hi> Amé, and <hi>S.</hi> Edward in their royall throanes &amp; duke-domes.

               <p n="1">1. YOVNG Tobias, commanded by his father to goe to the citie of Rages, ſaid, I know no whit of the way: goe then (replied his father) and ſeeke out ſome faithfull guide to conduct thee. The ſame ſay I to thee (my beloued Philotheus) deſireſt thou in good earneſt to walk to the citie of deuotion? ſeek ſome skilfull man to direct and lead thee. This is the rule of rules: and the aduertiſment of aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſments: for albeit thou ſearch neuer ſo curiouſly (ſayth the deuout Auila) thou shalt neuer ſo ſecurely and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly finde out the will of God, as by this ſafe way of humble obedience, ſo much recommended and practized by all his deuout and faithfull ſeruants in former times. The bleſſed Mother Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa, foundreſſe of the reformed Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melits,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:5901:24"/> ſeeing the ſtraunge and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie penances, which the great Ladie Catherin of Cardoua, exerciſed in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, in a wildernes of Spanie, was much moued in hart to imitate her therein, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to the aduice of her confeſſour, who had forbid her ſuch kind of auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities: yet was she tempted not to obay him in that behalfe: but God (who many times familiarly talked with her) ſayd vnto her: my daughter thou haſt alreadie begunne a very fafe and aſſured way: ſeeſt thou the penaunce of that good ladie? but I doe make more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of thy obedience. And therfore this bleſſed woman euer after ſo loued this virtue, that beſide the ordinarie obedience due vnto her ſuperiours, she made one vowe in particular, to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine learned &amp; excellent man, to folow in all things his direction, by which she found ineſtimable comfort and profit; as both before, and after her, many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout ſoules haue done the like, who to ſubiect them ſelues more perfectly to the will of God, ſubmitted their owne willes to the diſpoſition of his ſeruants: a thing which holy <hi>S.</hi> Catherin of Siena
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:5901:25"/> highly commendeth in her ſpirituall dialogues. The moſt virtuous princeſſe <hi>S.</hi> Elizabeth, ſubmitted her ſelfe moſt extraordinarilie to the direction of her ghoſtly confeſſour Conradus. And one of the laſt aduices that great <hi>S.</hi> Lewis gaue to his ſonne before his death, was in this in kind: confeſſe often &amp; chooſe a confeſſour of learning, and diſcretion, that can, and dare aduertiſe thee, to do ſuch things as are neceſſary for thy ſaluation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A faithfull frind</hi> (ſaith the holy ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) <hi>is a ſtrong protection: he that hath found him, hath found a treaſure. A faithfull frind is a medicin of life and immortallitie: ſuch as feare God doe finde ſuch a frind.</hi> Theſe ſacred wordes, as you may ſee, are principallie ſpoken of immortallitie, for the obtayning whereof, it is neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full aboue all thinges to haue this faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full frind, who may guide our actions by his prudentiall councell, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tergard vs, againſt the ambushments and ſlightes of our ghoſtly enemie. Such an one shall be vnto vs, as a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of wiſdome in all our afflictions, deſolations, and falles: he shall ſerue vs
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:5901:25"/> as a medicine to eaſe and comfort our hartes in our ghoſtlie diſeaſes: he will keepe vs from euill, and make what is good in vs, agreat deale better: and if any infirmities chance to befall vs, his carefull aſiſtance will procure, that it shall not be mortall, for he will lift vs vp againe from our downefall.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But who is he (ſay you) that shall be ſo happie as to finde ſuch a frind? The wiſe man in the ſame place tells vs, ſaying. <hi>They that feare God,</hi> they that with an humble minde, affectuoufly deſire their aduacement in pietie, and in the ſeruice and worship of their Creator. Seeing then that it importeth thee ſo much (my Philotheus) to goe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a good guide in this holy voyage of deuotion, pray vnto God with very great inſtance, that he will furnish thee with one according to his hart, and dout not, albeit it were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for this end, to ſend an Angell from heauen, as he did to young Tobias, but that he will giue thee a good one, and a faithfull.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And in verie deed, in place of an Angel ought he to be vnto thee, when
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:5901:26"/> thou haſt once found him. Regard him not ſimplie as a man, nether truſt in him, nor in his humaine prudence, but in the prouidence of almightie God, who wil no dout fauour thy indeuours, and ſpeake vnto thee by the meanes and interpoſition of this man: putting into his minde, and into his mouthe, that which shall be moſt expedient for thy ſpiritual aduancement: ſo that thou oughteſt to hearken vnto him, as vnto an Angell deſcended from heauen, to conduct and leade thee thither. Treate with him freely, and with an open hart, manifeſting without al diſſimulation or fayninge, the good and euil which thou findeſt in thy ſoule: and by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, thy good shall be more examined and aſſured, and thy euil corrected and amended: thou shalt be both eaſed and fortified in thy afflictions, and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ordered in thy conſolations. Place then an exceeding confidence in him, ioyned with a religious and reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue reuerence yet ſo, that the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence diminishe not thy confidence in him, nor thy confidence hinder the reuerence due vnto him: but truſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:5901:26"/> in him with trembling, as a chaſt may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den doth reſpect hir ſeuere, but louing father: and reſpect him with an aſſured truſt in his loue and care, as an obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſonne, would doe his deare and tender harted mother. In a woord, the frind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship betwixt thee and thy ghoſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor, muſt be ſtronge and ſweete, al holie, al ſacred, and all celeſtial.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For this cauſe, chooſe one amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge a thouſand, ſaith Auilla, but I ſay vnto thee, one amonge ten thouſand, for there are fewer to be found then men imagin, who are fit and capable of ſuch an office. He muſt be replenished with charitie, knowledg, and with prudence, for if but one of theſe three partes be wanting in him, it wil be dangerous for thy ſoule. Therfore once againe I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe thee, to demaund him inſtantly at the handes of almightie God, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing once obtayned him, bleſſe his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine maieſtie for ſo great a benefit.

               <head>That the begining of a deuout life, muſt be taken from the purgation of the ſoule. CHAPTER V.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>FLowers appeare in our ground,</hi> (ſayeth the ſpouſe in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles) <hi>the time of pruning our vines is come.</hi> What be the flowers of our hartes (ô Philotheus) but our good deſires? So ſoone then as they appeare, we muſt lay hand to the hooke, and cut from our conſcience, all withered, dead, and ſuperfluous workes. In the law of Moyſes, the ſtranger woman taken priſoner, that would marrie with an Iſralite, was to put of the robe of hir captiuitie, to pare hir nayles, and to cut away the treſſes of hir hayre: in like maner, the ſoule that aſpireth to the honour to be the eſpouſe of the Soune of God, muſt firſt put of the old man, and put on the new, caſt away and forſake ſinne, and then pare and shaue of all kind of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, which doe diuert from the loue of almightie God. It is the firſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:5901:27"/> begining of our health, to purge our corrupt and peccant humors. <hi>S.</hi> Paul euen in an inſtant, was purged and cleanſed with a perfect purgation. So was <hi>S.</hi> Marie Magdalen, <hi>S.</hi> Pelagia, <hi>S.</hi> Gatharin of Genua, and certaine others. But this kinde of purgation, is altogether miraculous and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in grace, as is the reſurrection of the dead in nature, and therfore we muſt not pretend therunto. The ordinary manner of purging and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ether body or minde, is not wrought but by litle and litle, and by proceeding from degree to degree, with paine, leaſure, and expectation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Angels had winges, vpon the myſterious ladder of the Patriarche Iacob, yet they flew not therfore, but aſcended, and deſcended by order from one ſtep to another. The ſoule which ariſeth from ſinne to deuotion, is fitly compared to the morning ſtarre, which in riſing expelleth not the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in a trice or moment, but grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim and by degrees. That cure (ſaith the Phyſiciens Aphoriſme) which is done faire and ſoftly, is alwayes moſt aſſured.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:5901:28"/> The diſeaſes of the ſoule, as wel as thoſe of the body, come to vs, as a man may ſay, in poſt, or a horſe back, but they depart from vs on foote, and faire and ſoftly. We muſt then be courageous (ô Philotheus) in vndertaking this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. Alas, what pittie is it of theſe ſoules, which ſeeing them ſelues ſubiect to ſundrie imperfections, after they haue bene exerciſed ſome few monthes in deuotion, begin to trouble, diſquiete, and diſcourage them ſelues, ſuffering their hartes almoſt to be borne away vnto the temptation of leauing of all, and returning back? But now on the other part, is it not an exceeding peril vnto thoſe ſoules, which by a contrary temptation, perſwade them ſelues to be purged from their imperfections, the firſt day, as it were, of their purgation, reputing them ſelues to be made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, before, in a manner, they be ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely made, and preſuming to flye, before they haue winges. O Philotheus, in what great danger are they, of falling againe into their former diſeaſes, for taking them ſelues to timely out of the handes of the phiſicien? <hi>It is in vaine to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:5901:28"/> riſe before the light</hi> (ſaith the kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) <hi>riſe after you haue ſitten.</hi> And he him ſelfe putting the ſame leſſon in practiſe, hauing bene washed &amp; clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from his ſinne, yet humbly deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to be washed againe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The exerciſe of purging ſoules, can not, nor may not end, but with our life. Let vs neuer therfore afflict our ſelues about our imperfections, for our perfection cheifly conſiſteth in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting againſt them, and we can not reſiſt them vnles we doe ſee them, nor can we van quish them, vnles we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter them. Our victorie conſiſteth not, in not feeling them, but in not conſenting nor yeelding vnto them: for to receaue vexation and trouble from them, is not to conſent vnto them: nay it is neceſſarie for the exerciſe of our humilitie, that we ſometime recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ſome ſmale blowes or foiles in this ſpiritual battaile: but we are neuer to be accounted for ouercome, but only when we leeſe ether life or courage. Now certaine it is, that imperfections and venial ſinnes, can not take from vs the life of grace, for that is neuer loſt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:5901:29"/> but by deadly ſinne. The only care then that remayneth is, that theſe imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions doe not daunt our courage. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer me ô Lord,</hi> ſaid Dauid, <hi>from cowardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and faintnes of hart.</hi> For this is the happie condition and aduantage which we haue in this ghoſtly warre, that we shal euer be conquerors, prouided alwayes that we wil combat.</p>

And renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the viſion, and euerlaſting loue of almightie God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thou perceiueſt, Philotheus, that I ſpeake in this place of a generall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of all thy life, the which truly, although I graunt that it is not alwayes abſolutely neceſſarie, yet doe I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, that it will be exceeding profitable vnto thee in this begining: and for this cauſe I doe moſt earneſtly exhort therunto.

               <p n="1">1. ALL the Iſraelites departed in effect out of the Land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt, but they departed not all in hart and affection; which was eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be ſeene, in that many of them in the deſert repined, for that they had not the onyons &amp; flesh potts of Egipt: euen ſo there are certaine penitents, who in effect goe foorth of ſinne, but neuertheles doe not vtterly leaue nor forſake the affection: that is to ſay, they purpoſe indeed to ſinne no more, but it
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:5901:31"/> is with a certaine harts-breake which they haue, to depriue them ſelues, and to abſtaine from the accurſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes and contentments of ſinne. Their hart renounceth ſinne and ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a loofe of, but they leaue not for all that, often times to looke that way, as Lotts wife looked back towardes Sodom. They abſtaine from ſinne, as ſick men doe from millons, which they forbeare, becauſe the phiſicien threatens them death if that they eate them: but not withſtanding this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned abſtinence, their fancie ſtil longeth after thoſe forbidden meates, they ſpeake of them, cheapen them, and would likewiſe buy of them, if it were lawfull, at the leaſt they wil ſinel to them, and account them happie that are not bound to forbeare them: euen ſo theſe feeble and faint harted penitents, refraine them ſelues from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne for awhile, but to their griefe, they wish to God, that they might ſinne, and not be damned: they talke with a kind of taſt and ſauour of ſinne, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted that doe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit them.</p>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:5901:31"/> wil change his wil when he comes to Confeſſion, but immediatly after, one may finde him amongſt his frindes, taking pleaſure and contentment in recounting his quarrel, ſaying, that had it not bene for the feare of God, he had done this, or he had done that: and that the deuine law, in this point of pardoning is very hard, and wisheth to God that it were lawful for him to be reuenged. Alas, who ſeeth not, that although this poore man be gotten faintly out of ſinne, yet that he is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether incenſed to the affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinne? that being foorth of Egipt in effect, he is yet there ſtil in wil and appetite, greedely deſiring the ruſtick fare of the onyons and garlick, which he was wont to eate: euen as a wanton wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that hath newly deteſted hir lewed loues, findes ſtil a delight to be courted and inuironed with hir fond wooers: alas what exceeding danger are ſuch people in?</p>

               <head>Of the meanes of applying this ſecond Purgation. CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <p n="1">1. NOW the foundation of this ſecond purgation, is a liuely and ſtronge apprehention of the greate harme which ſinne bringeth vnto vs, by meanes whereof, we enter into a profound and vehement Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For as neuer ſo litle Contrition (if it be true and vnfeined) eſpecially conioyned with the vertu of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, doth purge vs ſufficiently from the guilt of ſinne, ſo alſo when it is great and vehement, it purgeth vs from all the affections depending of ſinne. A hatred or rancour which is feeble and weake, cauſeth our hart to riſe at the very ſight of him whom we doe hate, and maketh vs to flie his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but if it be a violent and deadly hatred, it maketh vs not only to flye his company, but euen to be diſguſted, and not to endure the conuerſation of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:5901:33"/> any of his kinred, parents, or frindes, no, not ſo much as his picture it ſelfe, or of any thinge elſe appertayninge vnto him, but is abhominable and odious vnto vs: euen ſo when the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent hateth his ſinne, only with a weake and cold, though true Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he reſolueth fully and truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, neuer to offend nor ſinne any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, but when he hateth it with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition vigorous and forcible, he not only hateth and deteſteth the ſinne, but likewiſe all the affections, dependances, and pathes of ſinne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt then endeuour feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly, Philotheus, to augment as much as is poſſible for vs, our ſorrow, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and inward repentance, to the end that it may ſtretch and extend, to the leaſt appurtenance and ſparke of ſinne. So bleſſed Marie Magdalen in hir con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, loſt ſo perfectly all taſt of ſinne, and of the pleaſures she had taken ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that she neuer afterwardes thought more vpon them. And holy Dauid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſteth, that he not only hated ſinne, but alſo all the wayes and pathes of the ſame. And in this reſolution, conſiſteth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:5901:33"/> the renouation of the ſoule, wherby she returnes by innocencie to hir youthfull dayes; which the ſame prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth to the renewing of the eagle.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now to attaine this apprehention and Contrition, thou muſt exerciſe thy ſelfe dilligently in theſe meditations following, which being duly practiſed, will (by the helpe of Gods heauenly grace) roote out of thy hart all ſinne, as alſo the principall affections to the ſame: to this end haue I principally ordayned them. Thou shalt practiſe them therfore in order as I haue placed them, taking but one for euery day, and that in the morning, if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, which is the time moſt proper for all the actions of the ſpirit: and the reſt of the day following, rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and chew that which thou haſt meditated in the morning.

I do not ſay thou shalt diſcouer veniall ſinnes, but inclinations to them: now the one is farre differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from the other: for we can neuer be alltogether free from veniall ſinnes in this mortall life, at leaſt ſo to continue in that puritie for any long time, but we may be well without all affection vnto veniall ſinns: for (to giue an example of this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) it is one thinge to lie once or twice merrilie, in things of ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and another thing to take pleaſure in lying, and to beare an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to this kind of ſinne.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſay then, that one muſt purge his ſoule from all the affections and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:5901:60"/> that he feeleth to venial ſinnes, that is to ſay, that he muſt not nourishe, voluntarilie a will to continue and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuer, in any kind of veniall ſinne: for it would be too too great a negligence, to keepe wittingly and aware vnto vs in our conſcience, a thing ſo diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vnto God, as is the will to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge to diſpleaſe him: for a venial ſinne be it neuer ſo litle, diſpleaſeth almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, though not ſo hainouſly, that he will damne vs, or caſt vs away for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer for the ſame. Yf then veniall ſinne diſpleaſe him, the will and affection which one hath to venial ſinne, is no other thing, but a reſolution and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to diſpleaſe his diuine maieſtie. And how is it poſſible, that a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and noble ſoule, should indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, not onely to diſpleaſe his God, but to beare an affection to diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Such affections (my Philotheus) are directly contrarie to deuotion, as affection and delight in morrall ſinnes, are oppoſite to charitie: They wearie and weaken the forces of the ſpirit, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the courſe of diuine conſolations,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:5901:60"/> open wide a gate to tentations: and all-though they kil not the ſoule outright, yet they make it exceeding ſick and feeble. <hi>Dead flies</hi> (ſaith the wiſeman) <hi>marre the ſweetnes of an ointment:</hi> but thoſe which eate thereof in paſſing, ſpoyle nothing but that which they ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, leauing the reſt vntainted: but when they linger long and die in the ointment, they marre both the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and valew of it, and leaue it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth but to be caſt away. So veniall ſinnes, chauncing to fall in a deuout ſoule, and not ſtaying the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re any time, do not much harme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: but yf the ſame ſinnes dwell in the ſoule, through the affection &amp; delight wherwith she entertaineth them, they make hir without doubt, to leeſe the ſweetnes of the oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the grace of holie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion.</p>

Spiders kill not the bees in theire hiues, but they ſpoile and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt their honie, and entangle their honniecombs with theire cobweb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, ſo that the bees can not goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in theire worke. This is to be
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:5901:61"/> vnderſtood, when ſpiders get into the hiues ſo that they make their aboade in them. So venial ſinnes kill not our ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, but yet marre the honnie of our deuotion, and intangle the powers of our ſoule ſo ſtronglie with naughtie cuſtomes &amp; bad inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that it can no more exerciſe charitie with promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tnes and alacritie, in which deuotion conſiſteth: but this is to be vnderſtood when veniall ſinnes do dwell in our conſcience, by the affection &amp; delight which we beare vnto them.</p>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:5901:61"/> and ſpoiled. But I ſay once againe: what likely hood is there, that a noble and virtuous ſoule, would take pleaſure in diſpleaſing God: and delight her ſelf in beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming diſagreable vnto him, and to retaine a deſire and will to do that, which she knoweth to be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueous vnto him.</p>

GAMING, dancing, feaſting, brauerie, maskes, comedies &amp; ſuch like paſtimes, of them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues are not hurtfull at all, but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and may be well and ill vſed: yet notwithſtanding, theſe things be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: and for one to beare an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection vnto them, is yet more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. I ſay then Philotheus, that all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be no ſinne at all, but lawfull to play, to daunce, to deck and adorne thy ſelf, according to thy eſtate and the cuſtome of times, to heare honeſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:5901:62"/> to banquet with ſober compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: yet to delight in ſuch things, is exceeding dangerous, and alltogether contrarie to the exerciſe of deuotion. It is no ſinne to do ſuch things: but it is very ill to ſett thy affection that way. It is pittie to ſow ſuch vaine and foolish thoughts in the fertil field of our hart, which take vp the roome of virtuous impreſſions, and hinder the iuice of the ſoule from nourishing good and wholſome inclinations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The auncient Nazarits abſtained not onely from all that which might inebriate or make them dronck, but from grapes allſo, and the veriuce of grapes: not that the grape of veriuce maketh dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke, but becauſe it was to be feared leaſt taſting the veriuce, they should be tempted to eate the grapes, and by eating grapes they should ſtirre vp an appetite of drincking wine. I denie not but we may ſomtimes vſe theſe dangerous thinges, but I auouch abſolutely, that we can neuer ſetle our affection and delight on them, without detriment to deuotion. The Stagges when they feele themſelues ouerfatt,

Prayer is the water of benedictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which being ſprinckled vpon our ſoule, maketh the

               <p n="2">2. All prayer hath theſe good effects, but aboue all I counſel thee to applie thy ſelf to mentall and cordiall prayer, and eſpecially that which hath for its matter or ſubiect, the life and paſſion of our Lord: for beholding him often by meditation, thy ſoule wilbe filled with him, thou wilt learne his cariage, as it were and geſtures, and conforme all thy actions according to the meaſure and model of his. He is the light of the world: it is in him then, by him, and for him, that we muſt be cleered and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated; he is the louely tree of life: vnder his shadow then, muſt we refresh our ſelues; he is the liuing well of Iacob, to washe away all the ordure and ſtaines of our ſoule. To be short, we ſee that litle children by hearing their mothers ſpeak and pratling often with them, do come to learne their language: and ſo we continually conuerſing with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour by meditation, obſeruing and pondering reuerently, his words, his
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:5901:65"/> workes, &amp; his affections, shal ſoone, by the helpe of his grace, learne to ſpeak, to work, to will &amp; deſire as he did. We muſt reſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this reſolution my Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus, &amp; beleeue me we can not come vnto God the father by any other gate but this: &amp; eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the glaſſe of a mirrour cannot ſtay or retaine the rayes of our ey-ſight, vnleſſe the back be ſeeled with tinne or leade: ſo the deitie cannot well be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templated by vs in this world, yf it were not ioyned to the ſacred humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our Sauiour, whoſe life &amp; death is the moſt proportionable, delicious, ſweet and profitable obiect, that we can chooſe for our ordinary meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Our Sauiour, not for nothing caled him ſelf the bread of heuen: for as bread is to be eaten with all ſorts of meats: ſo our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours life muſt be meditated, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſought after, in all our prayers &amp; actions. This life &amp; death, hath been diſpoſed and diſtributed, into diuers points and paſſages to ſerue for medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, by many authours: thoſe whom I councell thee to vſe, are <hi>S.</hi> Bonauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Bellitan, Bruno and Capilia.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Employ in it euery day an houre, &amp;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:5901:65"/> that before dinner, yf it may be, beti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes at the beginning of the morning: for then shalt thou find thy ſpirit leſſe troubled and diſtracted, &amp; more freshe &amp; diſpoſed after the repoſe of the night. But ſpend no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an houre, vnleſſe thy ſpiritual father expreſſely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yf thou canſt performe this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in the church, and find leaſure and tranquilitie there, it would be a place moſt commodious: for no bodie, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther father nor mother, nor wife nor husband, nor any other whoſoeuer, can with any reaſon hinder thee to ſtay at the leaſt one houre in the church: wheras being ſubiect by any obligation ordutie to ſuch parties as I haue named in thy owne houſe, thou wilt not be able peraduenture, to promiſe thy ſelf an houre ſo free and quiet.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Begin all thy deuotions, be they mentall or vocal, with the preſence of God: keep this rule without faile, and without exception: and in short time thou shalt perceaue, what ineſtimable profit thou shalt reape by it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If thou wilt beleeue my councell, accuſtom thy ſelf to ſay thy <hi>Pater, Aue,</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:5901:66"/> and Creed in Latin: but learne likewiſe to vnderſtand well the words contained in them, and what they ſignifie in thyne owne lauguage: to the end that ſaying them in the common language of the church, thou maiſt iointly taſt and relish, the admirable and delicious ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of thoſe holy prayers: which thou muſt vſe to ſay, fixing profoundly thy thoughts vpon euery word of them, and procuring to folow the ſence of them with an enflamed affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: not making poſt haſt, or ſtriuing to ſay a great many; but rather ſtudying and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring to ſay thoſe which thou ſayeſt, from thy hart: for one onely <hi>Pater no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> ſayd with feeling and heedfull at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of mind and deſire, is better worth by faire, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many recited haſtely and with litle ponderation of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The beades or roſary of our ladie, is a very profitable kind of prayer, yf it be vſed as it ought: which that thou mayſt practize, prouide thy ſelf of ſome litle treatiſe or other, of many which be ſett foorth for that purpoſe. It is good alſo to ſay the letanies of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:5901:66"/> of the Saints, of our Sauiour, and other ſuch vocall prayers, as are in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued manualls &amp; primers allowed of by the church: with this item, that yf God haue beſtowed vpon thee the gift of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall prayer, thou reſerue alwais the principall place and time for it. So that yf after thy mentall exerciſe, either for multitude of thy affaires, or for any other reſpect, thou be not able to ſay thy accuſtomed vocall prayers: be not therfore troubled or diſquieted, but reſt content to ſay before, or after thy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, the Pater noſter, Aue, and Creed of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Yf in making thy vocall prayers, thou feele thy hart drawen and invited to inward mentall prayer, refuſe not to go where this good motion inuiteth thee, but let thy ſpirit decline faire and ſoftly on that ſide: and care not much for miſſing thy vocal prayers, which thou didſt intend; for the mentall prayer which thou haſt made inſteed therof, is much more pleaſing to God, and more profitable for thy ſoule. I except from this rule, the eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call office, for yf thou be bound to ſay
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:5901:67"/> it by obligation of order, or ſtate of life, that duty muſt firſt of all be payed and performed.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Yf it should ſo happen, that all the whole morning should paſſe away, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout performance of this ſacred exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of mentall prayer, either for the multitude of thy affaires, or any other cauſe (yet procure by all meanes poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that ſuch cauſes happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but ſeldom) endeuour to repaire this loſſe after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in ſome houre furtheſt after meate: for doing it preſently after repaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore degeſtion be well made, thy health would be much impaired, and thou shouldſt find thy ſelf ouercharged with drouſines. But yf all the day long, thou canſt not recouer this loſſe, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence it at leaſt by multiplying iacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie prayers, and by reading of ſome book of deuotion, with ſome penaunce or other for committing this fault: and therwithall make a ſtrong reſolution, to ſett thy ſelf in good order all the day folowing.</p>

               <head>A breef method of meditation. And first of the preſence of God, which is the firſt point of Preparation. CHAPTER 2.</head>
               <p n="1">1. BVT perhaps (Philotheus) thou knoweſt not, how thou ſhouldſt make this mentall prayer, which wee ſo much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend vnto thee: for it is a thing that in this our vnhappie age, verie few are acquainted withall. For this cauſe I preſent thee a breef &amp; ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple method to that end: vntill ſuch time as by reading of many good bookes that haue been co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſed vpon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, and aboue all by often vſe &amp; exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, thou be more amplie inſtructed. And firſt I ſett thee downe the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which conſiſteth in two points: wherof the firſt is to place thy ſelf in the preſence of God; and the ſecond, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke his ayde and aſſiſtance. To place thy ſelf in the preſence of God, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound vnto thee the four principall meanes folowing, wherwith thou maiſt help thy ſelf in this thy beginning.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The firſt conſiſteth in a liuelie &amp;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:5901:68"/> feeling apprehenſion of the omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, that is to ſay, to concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue and acknowledge, that God is in all, and euery where, and that there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place nor thing in the world, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is not moſt aſſuredly &amp; certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent: ſo that as the birds, wherſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they flie, encounter always with the ayre, wherwith they ar alway compaſſed: in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, where euer we be, we find God ſtill preſent. Euery one knoweth this veritie, but euery one is not atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to apprehend, and ponder it. Blind men that ſee not a Prince who is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them, omitt not to reſpect &amp; honour him, when they are admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed of his preſence: but becauſe they ſee him not with their eyes, they eaſily forgett that he is preſent, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, more eaſily omit their due reſpect and reuerence. Alas we ſee not God (my Philotheus) who is preſent allway with vs, though faith do aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe vs of his preſence: yet not ſeeing him with our eyes, we often forgett our ſelues, and therfore comport and carie our ſelues, as though God were very farre from vs. For allthough we
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:5901:68"/> knowe well enough that he is preſent in all things; yet not pondering, nor waying this preſence, it is euen as much as yf we knew it not. Therefore euer before prayer, we muſt prouoke our ſoule, to an attentiue ſight (as it were) and conſideration of Gods preſence: ſo did holy Dauid, when he cried out: <hi>If I mount into heauen, O my God, thou art there: yf I deſcend into hell thou art there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:</hi> we muſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vſe the words of Iacob, who after he had ſeene the myſtery of the ſacred ladder, he ſayd: <hi>O how holy and dreadfull is this place! verely God is in this place, and I knew it not:</hi> that is, he thought not of it: for he was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that God was in all, and euery where. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou comeſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to prayer (Philotheus) ſay inwardly to thy owne hart: O my hart, my hart, God almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is heer preſent in very deed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſecond meane to place thy ſelf in this ſacred preſence is, to thinck, and conſider, that God is not only in the place where thou art: but that he is by a moſt particular and peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in thy hart, and in the very bottom of thy ſpirit, which he quickeneth and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:5901:69"/> animateth with his diuine preſence, being there as the hart of thy hart, and the ſpirit of thy ſpirit. For as thy ſoule is as it were ſpread through all thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and in euery part and parcell ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and yet is in a more ſpeciall and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable manner preſent in the hart: ſo likewiſe God being verily preſent in all things, aſſiſteth notwithſtanding with a more particular &amp; notable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in our ſpirit. For this cauſe Dauid calleth God, the <hi>God of his hart,</hi> and <hi>S.</hi> Paul ſayeth, that, <hi>we liue, we moue, and wee are in God.</hi> In conſideration then of this veritie, ſtirre vp in thy hart, a great reuerence towards thy God, who is ſo inwardly preſent in thy ſoule.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The third manner of preſence is, to conſider and behold our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, who in his ſacred humanitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth from heauen all perſons in the world, but eſpecially all Chriſtians, who are his children, and moſt particularly ſuch as be in prayer: whoſe actions and behauiour, he marketh moſt louingly. And this is not a ſimple imagination of our phantaſie, but an infallible veritie: for allthough we ſee not him, yet he
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:5901:69"/> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence aboue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidereth &amp; looketh vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. <hi>S.</hi> Stephen ſaw him in ſuch ſort, viewing &amp; marking his comportme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in his martyrdom. So that we may truly ſay with the eſpouſe: <hi>Behold him there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the wal, look where he is looking through the windowes, ſeeing through the lettiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The fourth manner of preſence, conſiſteth in helping our ſelues with a ſimple imagination, by repreſenting to our thoughts, our Sauiour in his ſacred humanitie, as yf he were hard by vs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we are accuſtomed to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our frinds to our fancie, and to ſay, me thincks I ſee ſuch a one doing this or that, it ſeemes vnto me that I behold him thus or thus attired, and ſuch like.

               <p n="1">1. INVOCATION, is made in this manner. Thy ſoule remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring and conceauing her ſelf to be in the preſence of God, proſtrate before his diuine maieſtie with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, acknowledgeth her ſelf moſt vnworthy to abide before ſo ſoueraigne and glorious an excellency: yet kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing notwithſtanding, that his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes will haue it ſo, she humbly demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth grace of him, to ſerue him well, and adore him purely in this her medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yf thou wilt, to this end thou mayſt vſe ſome short and inflamed words, ſuch as be theſe of holy Dauid. <hi>Caſt me not</hi> (ô God) <hi>from thy face: take

               <p n="1">1. AFTER theſe two ordinarie pointes of preparation, there is a third, which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vnto all ſorts of meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which ſome call, the forming or figuring of the place, or an interiour lecture, or reading of the paſſage to be meditated on. And this is nothing els, but to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto thy imagination, the ſumme and ſubſtance of the myſterie which thou wilt meditate, and to paint it out in thy thoughts ſo liuelie, as though it paſſed reallie &amp; verylie in thy preſence. For example ſake: yf thou wouldeſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate our Lord vpon the croſſe, imagin thy ſelf to be preſent vpon the mount of Caluary; and that there thou behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and heareſt, all that is done or ſayd in the paſſion of our Lord; or yf thou wilt (for it cometh all to one end) ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin

               <p n="2">2. The like may be done, when thou wilt meditate of death, as I haue noted in the meditation therof: and likewiſe in the meditation of hell: and in all ſuch myſteries, in which viſible and ſenſible things are ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled; for as touching other ſorts of myſteries, of the greatnes of God; of the excellencie of virtue; of the end for which we were created, and ſuch like, which be inuiſible things, and not ſubiect to the apprehenſion of our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; in theſe queſtionleſſe, we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not vſe this kind of imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <p n="3">3. By the meanes of this imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we lock vp our ſpirit as it were, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin the cloſet of the myſterie which

               <p n="4">4.

               <p n="2">2. Hauing then shutt vp thy mind and thought (as I ſaid before) within the bounds, and limits of the ſubiect, which thou wilt meditate on, either by imaginarie repreſentation, yf the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <p n="1">1. MEDITATION poureth out abundance of good motions in our will, or the affectiue part of our ſoule: ſuch as are, the loue of God &amp; of our neighbour; the deſire of Paradiſe, and eternall glory; zeale of the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſoules; imitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the life of our Lord; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ioye, feare of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of hell, of being in the diſgrace of God; hatred of ſinne; confidence in the goodnes, and mercy of God; shame and confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our naughty life paſſed; In theſe and ſuch like affections, our ſpirit muſt burſt out, and extend and ſtretche it ſelf, as much as is poſſible And yf thou deſire to learne an eaſie method how to do ſo, reade the preface of the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Andrew Capillia, where he sheweth plainly the maner and trace of dilating and amplifiyng, and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding theſe affects of out ſoule: and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:5901:74"/> more largely doth Arias declare the ſame in his treatiſe of prayer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now thou muſt not content thy ſelf with theſe generall affections, be they neuer ſo feruourous and holie, nor ſtand onlie vpon them, but deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to ſpeciall and particular reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for thy correction and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For example; the firſt word that our Lord ſpake vpon the croſſe, will doubtleſſe ſtirre vp in thy ſoule a good affect of imitation, and a deſire to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thy enemies, and to loue them for thy Saueours ſake and example: but this generall affect and deſire is to ſmall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, yf thou adde not to it a particular reſolution, in this manner; Well ſince my bleſſed redeemer ſo louingly did pardon theſe obſtinate enemies of his, hanging vpon the bitter croſſe, I will not heerafter be troubled or vexed whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I heare my neighbour, or my ſeruant, or felow N. vſe ſuch or ſuch tanting words againſt me: I will not be aggrieued at this or that deſpite, or contemptuous trick, that he, or she doth vſe againſt me: but rather I will endeuour to ſay &amp; doe ſuch and ſuch a thing, to gaine his

And the like deſcent to particular purpoſes of amendment, muſt be made in all other generall affections. By this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes (Philotheus) thou shalt correct and amend thy defects in very short time: wheras otherwiſe, by only generall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and deſires, amendment will be made but hardly and ſlowly.</p>

               <p n="1">1. LAST of all, we muſt conclude our meditation by three acts, which muſt be done with the greateſt humilitie that we can. The firſt act is, Thanks-giuing vnto God for the holy affections, and reſolutions, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, which he hath inſpired into vs: and for his goodnes, and mercy, which we haue diſcouered in the diſcourſe of our meditation.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:5901:75"/>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond acte, is an oblation, wherin we preſent and offer vnto God, the ſelf ſame goodnes, &amp; mercie of his, which we haue taſted in meditating; the death alſo, and paſſion, virtues, and merits of his only Sonne our redeemer; and conſequently with them, all the affections and reſolutions which by his holy grace, we made in our exerciſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third acte, is a petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; in which we demaund of God, and earneſtly coniure him (as it were) to communicate and impart vnto vs, the graces, virtues, and merits of his deer Sonne; and to bleſſe the affections and reſolutions which we haue made in his honour, and name, to the end we may faithfully put them in execution. After theſe three acts, we muſt pray for the whole churche of God, for our countrie, paſtours, parents, and frinds: imploying and imploring to that end, the interceſſion of our bleſſed Ladie, of the glorious Angels, &amp; holy Saints of heauen. Laſtly I haue aduiſed that thou shouldſt ſay a Pater, an Aue, and a Creed; which is the generall and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie prayer of all the faithfull.</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:5901:75"/>
               <p n="4">4. To all theſe acts I haue added, that thou shouldſt gather a litle noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay of deuotion; my meaning in this may be vnderſtood by this example. Such as haue delighted them ſelues walking in a pleaſant garden, go not ordinarily from thence, without taking in their hands, four or fiue flowers to ſmell on, and keepe in theire hands all the daye after. Euen ſo, when our mind hath ſpirituallie recreated it ſelf, by affectiue diſcourcing and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome ſacred myſterie, we should cull out, one or two points which we haue found moſt pleaſing to our taſt, and moſt agreeable to our vnderſtanding, vpon which we might buſie our mind, and as it were mentally ſmell theron all the reſt of the day. And this muſt be done immediatlie in the ſelf ſame place, where we made our meditation, walking alone a turne or two, and binding thoſe points in our memorie, as we would do flowers in a litle noſegay.</p>

               <p n="1">1. ABOVE all things Philotheus, when thou ariſeſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber carefully the reſolutions &amp; purpoſes which thou haſt deliberated, and made: endeuouring to put them in practize that very day. This is the chiefeſt fruict of meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which oft times, it is not onely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, but hurtfull; for virtues me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated, and not practized, do puffe vp the mind, and make vs ouerboldlie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that we be ſuch in deed, as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, and purpoſed to be: which doubtleſſe is true, when our reſolutions be liuelie &amp; ſolid: but they are not ſuch, but rather they are vaine and da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous, yf they be not brought to practize and exerciſe. We muſt therfore vſe all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and ſearche out all occaſions of executing our good purpoſes: ſo that, yf in my meditation I reſolued by Gods grace, to winne the minds of ſuch as
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:5901:76"/> haue offended me, by faire meanes, and ſweet behaueour: I muſt caſt this verie day how to meet with them, to ſalute them courteouſlie; or yf I cannot meet with them, to ſpeak well of them, and to pray vnto God for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. At the end of thy exerciſe, take heede thou giue not thy hart ſcope to raunge and wander; leaſt thou ſpill the delicious balme of good thoughts, and holie deſires which thou haſt receaued by prayer. My meaning is, that for ſome time after, thou keep thy ſelf ſilent and quiet, &amp; not preſentlie with haſtineſſe, but fair &amp; ſoftlie, remoue thy hart from thy prayers, to thy affaires: and in the verie entraunce into other buſines, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to keep as long as is poſſible, the feeling and taſt of thoſe good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which thou haſt receaued in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation. Any man that had receaued ſome pretious liquor in a faire porcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, or china platter, to carie home to his houſe, would go with it, faire and ſoftly, neuer almoſt looking aſide, but always either before him, for feare that by ſtumbling he should marre all; or elſe vppon his veſſel, to ſee
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:5901:77"/> that he ſpill not the liquor which he ſo much eſteemeth: Euen ſo muſt thou doe when thou haſt ended thy medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; not diſtract thy ſelf all at once, but looking ſimplie before thee; as for example. If thou chance to meet with any whome thou art bound to heare or entertain, ſo that there is no remedie but thou muſt needs accommodate thy ſelf to his conuerſation, yet look often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo vpon thy hart, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious liquor of holie prayer, be not poured out, but the leſt that may be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Accuſtom thy ſelf to paſſe with facilitie and eaſines, from prayer to all kind of buſineſſe, which thy vocation and profeſſion juſtly and lawfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of thee, be they neuer ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the affections which thou receaueſt in prayer: So let the aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate learne to paſſe from prayer to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the merchant to his traffick, the maried woman to her houſwifrie, and care of her familie, with that ſweetnes and tranquillitie, that their minds be neuer a whit troubled or vexed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: for ſince the one and the other, that is, prayer and our neceſſarie oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:5901:77"/> are according to the will of God, we muſt learne to go from the one to the other, with an humble and deuout ſpirit, and folow the will, and ordonance of God, both in the one and the other.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Many times immediatly after preparation, thy affection wilbe alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether fired, and inflamed, with deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God: and then Philotheus, thou muſt lett go the bridle to thy affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: that they may runne freely after the inuiting of Gods ſpirit, without kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that method which I haue ſet downe. For although ordinarilie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations ought to goe before affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and reſolutions: yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, when the holy Ghoſt poureth foorth deuout affections, and holy motions in to thy ſoule without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cource and conſideration, thou muſt not then ſpend time in diſcourcing the points of thy exerciſe; for thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cources ſerue for no other end, but to ſture vp good affections, which in this caſe the holy Ghoſt graciouſly ſtirreth vp, and therfore need no diſcource at all. In a woorde, when ſo euer good
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:5901:78"/> affects, and deuout motions offer them ſelues vnto thee, receaue them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and make them roome in thy hart, whether they come before, or after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the conſiderations propoſed in thy exerciſe. Though I haue placed in the aboue-written examples of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, the affections in order after all the conſiderations and points of diſcource: I did it only to diſtinguish more plainlie and intelligiblie the parts and acts to be vſed in prayer: ſo that notwithſtanding that order there ſett downe, take this for a generall rule, neuer to reſtrain, or with-hold thy affections once inflamed with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout motion, but let them haue their free courſe: And this is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, not only of the affections fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the conſiderations, but alſo of the three acts of thanks giuing, oblation, and petition, which may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be vſed amid the conſiderations when they offer them ſelues feruently: although afterward, for the concluſion of the meditation, thou muſt repeat them againe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As for reſolutions and particular
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:5901:78"/> purpoſes drawne from thoſe generall affections, make them alway after the affections them ſelues, and about the end of thy exerciſe, before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of it: for yf we should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto our thoughts particular and familiar obiects, in the heat of our meditation and affection, they would put vs in danger of cooling our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, and to enter into diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Amid theſe affections and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, it is good to vſe collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies, or familiar talke, as it were ſomtime with God our Lord, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time with our bleſſed Ladie, with the Angels, and perſons repreſented in the myſterie which we meditate, with the Saints of heauen, with our ſelues, with our owne hart, with ſinners, yea and with inſenſible creatures: as we ſee that holy Dauid doth in his pſalmes, and other deuout Saints in their prayers and meditations.</p>

               <p n="1">1. VVE retire our ſelues into God, becauſe we aſpire vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: and we aſpire vnto him, to retire vs into him; ſo that the aſpiring of the ſoule vnto God, and the ſpirituall retreat, do mutuallie enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine one another, and both of them proceed and iſſue from holy thoughts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Aſpire then verie often from the bottom of thy hart vnto God (ô my Philotheus) through brief and short, yet burning &amp; inflamed deſires, darted from thy ſoule: admire his beautie; call vpon him for his aſſiſtance; caſt thy ſelf in ſpirit at the foote of the croſſe; adore his goodnes; queſtion with him often about thy ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; giue thy ſoule vnto him a thouſand times a day; faſten the inward view of thy ſoule vpon his ineſtimable ſweetnes; ſtretch foorth thy band vnto him, as a litle child doth to his Father, that he may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duct thee: place him in thy boſome like a ſweet-ſmelling
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:5901:86"/> poſie; plant him in thy ſoule like an encouraging ſtandart: finally make a thouſand ſorts and diuerſities of motions in thy hart, to enkindle the loue of God within thee, and to engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in thy ſoule a paſſionate and tender affection of this diuine ſpouſe. Thus are iaculatory prayers made, which that great <hi>S.</hi> Auſten ſo carefully councelled the deuout ladie Proba to vſe. O Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus, our ſpirit once giuing it ſelf enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relie to the companie, hant, and familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of his God, muſt needs be all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed, with the odoriferous ayre of his perfections.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This exerciſe is nothing hard or vneaſie: it may be enterlaced with all our occupations, without any hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance of them at all: for whether we retire our ſelues ſpirituallie, or whether we vſe onlie theſe feruorous deſires &amp; darts of deuout loue; we do no other thing, but make certain short digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as it were ſtepping a litle from our buſines in hand, to talke aword or two with our God: which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder, but rather help forward, the proſequuting and performance
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:5901:87"/> of the affaires which we were about. The weerie Pilgrim that taketh a litle wine to comfort his hart, and refreshe his mouth, allthough he make ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtay in drinking, breaketh not off his iourney for all that ſtay, but gaineth more force to end it more ſpeedilie, he only reſting, to trauaile afterwards ſo much the better.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Many authours haue gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether abundantly, ſtore of vocal aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which out of all dout are very profitable: but in my iudgement, it is better not to bind thy ſelf to any ſort of words, but only pronounce either in hart, or by mouth, thoſe words that feruent and holy loue shall by the way ſuggeſt vnto thee, for true loue will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish thee, with as many as thou canſt deſire. True it is that there are certain words, with haue a particular force and efficacie to content and ſatisfie the hart in this behalf: ſuch are the daintie ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghes, and paſſionate complaints, and louing exclamations that are ſowed ſo thick in the pſalmes of Dauid; the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten inuocation of the ſweet &amp; delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full name of IESVS; the louely paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:5901:87"/> which be expreſſed in the Canticle of Canticles; and ſpirituall ſongs alſo do ſerue for this ende, when they be ſong with attention.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To conclude, as they that be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured with humane and natural loue, haue almoſt alway their thoughts fixed vpon the parſon beloued, their hart full of affection towards hir, their mouth flowing with hir praiſes; when their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued is abſent they leeſe no occaſion to teſtifie their paſſions by kind letters, and not a tree do they meet with all, but in the barck of it, they engraue the name of their darling: euen ſo ſuch as loue God feruently, can neuer ceaſe thincking vpon him, they draw their breath only for him, they ſigh and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for their abſence from him, all their talk is of him: and yf it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they would graue the ſacred name of our Lord IESVS, vpon the breſts of all the men in the world.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And certainly all creatures do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite them to this, and not one but in its kind, declareth vnto them the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their beloued: and as <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtin ſayth (taking it from <hi>S.</hi> Anthony) all

A Leue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, ſtarted, and ſore preſſed by hounds, as this holy prelat went on a iourney, ran vnder his horſe, as to the beſt place of refuge that the imminent danger of death ſuggeſted; and the hounds bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king &amp; baying round about, durſt not preſume to violate the ſanctuarie, to which their prey had taken recourſe: a ſight truly very extraordinarie; wherat when all the traine laughed, great <hi>S.</hi> Anſelme, anſwered weeping &amp; ſighing: Ah (ſayd he) you laugh at the matter, but the poor beaſt laugheth not; the enemies of the ſoule (combatted &amp; ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handled on all ſides by multitudes of tentations &amp; ſinnes) do expect &amp; beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge her at the narrow paſſage of death: &amp; she wholly affrighted, ſeeketh ſuccour and refuge on euery ſide, which yf she

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bkin (ſayd he weeping for compaſſion) how liuely doſt thou expreſſe the death of my Saueour? That great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent perſonage of our dayes, Francis Borgia, while he was yet duke of Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, going a hunting, made to him ſelf a thouſand of theſe deuout conceipts. I was wont to admire (ſayd he, recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it afterward) how the faulcons co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to hand, ſuffring their eyes to be hood-winckd, and their talents to be bound to the pearch: &amp; that men are ſo ſtubborne &amp; rebellious to the voice &amp; cal of almightie God. <hi>S.</hi> Baſil the great ſayth, that the roſe among the thornes &amp; briers, ſeemeth to make this exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:5901:90"/> to men. <hi>Whatſoeuer is moſt pleaſant in this world, ô mortal men, is entermingled with ſerow: nothing is pure and vnmixed: griefs be always companions of myrth, and widdowhead of mariage, and care of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ioined with fertilty &amp; ahoundance of children, shame folowes glory, expences waite vpon honours, diſguſt is the ſauce of delicate dishes, and ſicknes pue-felow of health. A fair flower is the roſe</hi> (ſayth this holy man) <hi>but yet it filleth me with ſadnes, putting me in mind of my ſinne, for which the earth hath been condemned to bring foorth thornes and bryers.</hi> Adeuout ſoule beholding the skie and the ſtarres in a faire moon-shine night, repreſented in a cleer fountaine, O my God (ſayd shee) theſe ſelf ſame ſtarres shall one day be vnder my feet, when thou shalt vouchſafe to lodge me in thy holy tabernacle, and as the ſtarres of heauen are repreſented in this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth: Euen ſo all men of this earth are liuenly repreſented in heauen in the liuing well of the diuine charitie. A nother ſoule ſeeing a riuer ſwiftly flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, cried out in this manner: my ſoule shall neuer take reſt, vntill she be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp in the boundleſſe ſea of the

Another looking vpon the fruittrees of an orchard, which were all bedecked with their timely bloſſoms, ſighed &amp; ſayd, ay me wretch that I am, wherfore am I alone without bloſſom or budd in the orchard of holy churche? Another ſeeing litle chickens gathered together vnder their mothers wings, that ſat louingly couring ouer them: O Lord (ſayd he) preſerue vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wings of thy diuine proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Another looking vpon the heliotropium, that openeth and shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his leaues with the riſing and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the ſunne: when shall the time be (ſayd he) O my God, that my ſoule in this manner shall wholly folow the inuitement of thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and attraction of thy holy ſpirit?
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:5901:91"/> Another ſeeing the flowers which we call panſies, faire to the eye, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſweet odour.

               <p>See my Philotheus, how eaſilie and redilie a man may draw good thoughts and holy inſpirations, from all things great and ſmall that are preſented to our ſences and vnderſtanding in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of this mortal life. Moſt vnhappy be they which do turne aſide the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from their creatour, to chaunge &amp; apply them to ſinne: And happie are they that turne all the creatures to the glorie of their creatour, and do employ their fading vanitie, to the honour of the euerlaſting veritie. My cuſtom (ſayth <hi>S.</hi> Gregory Nazianzen) hath been allways, to accommodate and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie all things to my ſpirituall profit. Read the Epitaphe or funeral ſermon, which <hi>S.</hi> Hierom hath made in honour of holy Paula, for it is worthy the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſee how it is all as it were pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with ſacred affects, aſpirations, and deuout conceipts, which that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

And although it may ſo happen, that one doth as good exerciſes alone, as in the confraternitie with others; and perchaunce feeleth more ſpirituall delight and comfort by performing them alone in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: yet is God much more glorified by the vnion and contribution which we make with our bretheren and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, in good works and deuout exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <head>How to receaue inſpirations. CHAPTER 18.</head>
               <p n="1">1. VVE call inſpiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, all thoſe inward allureme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, reproches, remorſes, lights, and knowledges, which God worketh in vs, preuenting our hart with his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, through his fatherly care and loue of vs, to the end he might awake vs, ſtirre vs vp, driue and drawe vs to virtue, to heauenly loue, to good reſolutions, and in a word, to all thoſe things which lead and direct vs to our euerlaſting good. Theſe inſpirations in the ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, the bridegroome calleth, knocking at the gate, and ſpeaking to the hart
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:5901:99"/> of his eſpouſe; to wake her when she ſleepeth; to crie and call after her, when she abſenteth her ſelf: to inuite her to his honnie, and to gather apples in his orcharde, and flowers in his garden; to ſing, and cauſe to ſound her ſweete voice to delight his eares.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I need a compariſon to declare my meaning. Three things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the matching, or ſtriking vp of a marriage, on the maidens behalfe that muſt be married. Firſt, the partie is propounded vnto her: ſecondly, she likes of the propoſition: thirdly, she giueth her conſent. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likewiſe God, intending to work in vs, by vs, and with vs, ſome acte of charitie, firſt of all he propoſeth it vnto vs by inſpiration; ſecondly, we accept it with delight; and thirdly, we giue our full conſent vnto it. For as to deſcend vnto ſinne, there are three ſteppes or degrees, tentation, delight, and conſent: ſo there are three other ſtaires to aſcend vnto grace and virtue inſpiration, which is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to tentation; the delight felt in the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:5901:99"/> inſpiration, contrarie to the delight taken in dallying with the tentation; and conſent to the inſpiration, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the conſent giuen to the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For, though the inſpiration should endure all our life long, yet should we not be acceptable vnto God, if we took no delight nor contentment in it, nay contrarywiſe, his diuine maieſtie would be highly offended with vs, as he was with the Iſraelits, with whom he had beene labouring, forty yeares (as he ſayth him ſelf) and ſoliciting their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, in all which time they would not giue eare vnto him: wherupon he ſware againſt them in his wrath, that they should neuer enter into his reſt. So likewiſe, the gentleman that had long time ſerued his miſtris, should be much diſobliged, if after al this she would in no caſe hearken to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage which he deſired.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The pleaſure which one taketh in inſpirations, is a great aduancement to the glorie of God, and by it one beginneth alreadie to pleaſe his diuine maieſtie. For although</p>

               <p>Conſent to the motion which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpireth and propoundeth, but with a perfect, conſtant, and reſolut conſent, that admitteth no wauering or doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: For ſo God almightie, whome thou canſt not oblige with all thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, will not with ſtanding louingly hold him ſelf obliged vnto thee for thy affection.</p>
               <p n="7">7.

               <head>Of holy Confeſsion. CHAPTER 19.</head>
               <p n="1">1. OVR Saueour hath left in his church the holy ſacrament of Confeſſion, or Penaunce, that in it we may washe our ſelues from all our ſinnes, when ſoeuer we be defiled with them. Suffer not thy hart (my Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotheus) any long time to continue ſoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the ordure of ſinne, ſince thou haſt ſo eaſie a remedie to cleanſe thee with all.</p>

               <p n="2">2. The Lioneſſe hauing layen with the leopard, goeth preſently to ſome brook to washe away the ſtinche which that diſloyall fact of hers leaues in her bodie, leaſt her Lion finding it by the ſmell, should be offended therwith. The ſoule which hath conſented to ſinne, should feele a horrour and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of her ſelfe, and procure to washe away that filth, for reuerence and reſpect of the eyes of Gods diuine maieſtie, which behold her. And what should make vs to die this ghoſtly death, hauing ſo ſoueraigne a remedie to reuiue vs?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Confeſſe thy ſelfe humbly, and deuoutly once euery ſeuenight, and euer before thou communicateſt, if it be poſſible: allthough thou feele not thy conſcience charged with guilt of any mortall ſinne. For by confeſſion, thou doeſt not onely receaue abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of thy veniall ſinnes, which thou mayſt then confeſſe: but alſo iointly great force and vigour to avoide them heerafter, and a cleere light and knowledge to iudge and diſcerne them, and abundance of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:5901:101"/> heuenly grace, to repaire all the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage which thou haſt incurred by them. By confeſſion thou practizeſt the noble virtues of humilitie, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſimplicitie, and charitie: in a word, in this only act of confeſſion, thou exerciſeſt more virtues, then in any other whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Procure alway to bring with thee to confeſſion a true ſorow and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the ſinnes which thou wilt confeſſe, be they neuer ſo litle: and a firme ſetled reſolution to amend them heerafter. Many of cuſtom confeſſe their veniall ſinnes in a kind of braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, not purpoſing at all to amend them, continewing therfore all their life charged with the burden of them, and looſe by that meanes infinit bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and graces of the ſpirit. Yf then thou confeſſe to haue lyed in matter of ſmall importance, without harming any man, to haue ſpoken ſome inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or idle word, or to haue played ouermuch: repent thy ſelf hartely for theſe ſinnes, and purpoſe in very deed to amend. For it is a great abuſe of the ſacrament, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe any kind of ſinne,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:5901:102"/> be it mortall, or be it venial, without any will or deſire to be purged and cleanſed from it; ſince Confeſſion, was inſtituted for no other end, but to puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vs from ſinne.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Make not thoſe ſuperfluous accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations which many doe of cuſtome: I haue not loued God ſo well as I ought: I haue not prayed with ſo great deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as I should. I haue not made much of my neighbour as I ought to haue done: I haue not receaued the ſacrament with ſo great reuerence as I ought, and ſuch like. For ſaying ſuch like accuſations, thou bringeſt nothing in particular, that may make thy confeſſour vnderſtand the eſtate of thy conſcience: for all the men vpon earth, and all the Saincts of paradiſe, may ſay the ſelfe ſame with all truth, if they should come to Confeſſion. Conſider therfore what particular ſubiect or cauſe thou haſt to accuſe thy ſelf in that generall manner, and when thou haſt diſcouered it, then accuſe thy ſelf of that default ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie and plainly. For example, when thou accuſeſt thy ſelf not to haue
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:5901:102"/> cherished thy neighbour as thou oughteſt to haue done, peraduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, becauſe hauing ſeene ſome poore body in great neceſſitie, whome thou mighteſt eaſily haue ſuccoured and comforted, thou didſt neglect that good occaſion of doing that worke of mercie. Well then in this caſe, accuſe thy ſelf thus in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Hauing ſeene a poore man in neceſſitie, I did not aſſiſt him as I could well haue done, through my meere negligence, or hardnes of hart, or contempt, or ill will borne to the partie; or according as thou knoweſt the occaſion of that default. So likewi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe accuſe not thy ſelfe that thou haſt not prayed vnto God with ſuch deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as thou oughteſt; but if thou haſt admitted any voluntary diſtractions, or neglected to take conuenient place, due time, and leaſure requiſite for attention in prayer, accuſe thy ſelf with all plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſimplicitie of that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar cauſe of thy default, not alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thoſe generall tearmes, which make the confeſſion neither hot nor cold.</p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:5901:103"/>
               <p n="6">6. Thinck it not enough to confeſſe thy veniall ſinnes, but accuſe thy ſelf alſo of the motiue which induced thee to committe them. For example, be not content to ſay that thou haſt lyed without endamaging any perſon: but declare whether it was for vainglorie to praiſe, or to excuſe thy ſelf: or for vaine myrthe, or for willfull ſtubbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Yf thou haue ſinned in gaming, expreſſe whether it were for greedines of lucre, or for conuerſation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie ſake: and ſo foorth of other ſinnes. Manifeſt likewiſe how long thou haſt perſeuered in the ſinne which thou confeſſeſt; for continuance of time, is a circumſtance noteablie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing and aggrauating the guilt of the ſinne. Becauſe there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt a light vanitie or foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie, that preſentlie is giuen ouer, and layd a ſide, or which ſlippeth into our ſpirit for ſome quarter of an hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re: and one wherin our hart hath beene ſteeped and ſouced for two or three dayes. We muſt then confeſſe the particular fact, the motiue, and the continuance of our ſinnes. For
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:5901:103"/> though ordinarilie we are not bound to be ſo punctuall in explicating our veniall ſinnes, nay we are not abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telie bound to confeſſe them at all: yet they that deſire to cleanſe and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie their ſoules in good ſort, the better to attaine to the perfection of true deuotion, muſt be carefull to manifeſt and lay open to their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Phyſician, the diſeaſe wherof they wishe to be healed, be it neuer ſo litle.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Spare not to tell plainlie what ſoeuer is requiſite to declare purelie the qualitie of thy offence, as the cauſe, ſubiect, or occaſion which thou haſt taken to be angrie, or to ſupport and maintaine one in his faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te. For example: A certaine perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage to whome I beare no liking at all, by chaunce ſpeaketh to me ſome merrie word in ieſt, and I conſtrue it in the worſle part, riſing into cholar for it: wheras yf an other man that had been more agreable and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to me, had ſpoken a shrodder worde, I should haue taken it in good part. In ſuch a caſe, I will
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:5901:104"/> not omitt to ſay: I haue vſed cholerick and angrie ſpeeches againſt a certaine parſon, taking in ill part at his hands ſome words which he ſpake to me, not ſo much for the qualitie of the wordes in them ſelues, as for the litle good will or liking I had of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that ſpake them. And yf it were moreouer needfull to expreſſe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie angrie termes, vſed againſt that partie, to declare thy ſelf the better, I will thinck it were good to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe them: for accuſing thy ſelf ſo plainly and cleerly, thou doeſt not onely diſcouer the fault committed, but with all the naughtie inclinations, cuſtoms, and habits and other roots of ſinne: ſo that by this meanes thy ghoſtly father cometh to haue a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecter knowledge of the conſcience which he dealeth with, and of the remedies moſt conuenient to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied vnto it. Yet muſt thou allways procure to conceale the third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who haue been partakers with thee in the offence, as much as is poſſible.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Take diligent heede of manie
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:5901:104"/> couuert ſinnes which raigne ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly and inſenſiblie in our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that we ſcarcely perceaue or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer them: And that thou maiſt find them out, and know them when thou meeteſt with them, read atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuelie the 6. 27. 28. 29. 33. &amp; 36. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the third part, and the 8. th. chapter of the 4. th. part.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Chaunge not lightly nor eaſilie thy Confeſſour, but hauing made choice of a ſufficient one, continew conſtantlie, rendring him account of thy conſcience on the dayes and times appointed, opening to him freely and plainly, the ſinnes thou haſt committed from time to time: and monthly, or from two months, to two months, tell him likewiſe the eſtate of thy inclinations, though thou haue not ſinned by them: as whether thou be tormented with ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or with peeuishnes: whether thou be giuen to ouer much myrthe, or deſirous of gaine, or ſuch like inclinations.</p>

               <p n="1">1. IT is ſaid, that Mithridates king of Pontus, hauing inuented the Mithridate, ſo ſtrengthened his bodie by the meanes of the ſame, that endeuouring afterward to poiſon him ſelfe, ſo to auoide the ſeruitude of the Romans, he could not poſſiblie do it. Our bleſſed Sauiour hath inſtituted the venerable Sacrament of the Euchariſt, which containeth really and verilie his flesh and his bloud, to the end that he that eateth it, should liue eternallie. Who ſo euer then shall vſe it often with ſincere deuotion, ſo confirmeth his health, and ſecureth the life of his ſoule: that it is all moſt impoſſible he should be empoiſoned with any kind of naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie affection. One cannot be nourished with this flesh of life, and yet liue in affections of death. Man dwelling in the terreſtriall paradiſe, could neuer haue died corporally, through virtue of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:5901:105"/> the tree of life, which God had planted there: ſo cannot good Chriſtians in the church of God die ſpirituallie, through the efficacie of this Sacrament of life. Yf the tendreſt fruits that be, and moſt ſubiect to corruption, as cherries, ſtraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, and apricocks, be preſerued eaſilie all the yeare long, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited in ſugar or honnie: it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that our harts, though neuer ſo fraile and feeble, be preſerued from the rott of ſinne, when they be candied and ſugred with the incorruptiblie fleshe and bloud of the Sonne of God. O Philotheus, thoſe Chriſtians that muſt be damned for their naughtines, will be without replie, when the iuſt iudge shall make them ſee the wrong that they did them ſelues, to incurre ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall death: ſeeing it was ſo facil a thing for them to maintaine them ſelues in life and health, by the ſacramentall manducation or eating of his bodie, which he had left vnto them, for that end.

               <p n="4">4. But Saint Auguſtin, as thou haſt heard (my Philotheus) exhorteth and councelleth verie earneſtlie to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, euery ſunday: folowe his councell then, and doe ſo as neare as it is poſſible: for I preſuppoſe thou haſt no kind of affection at all to mortall ſinne, nor any delight or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to veniall ſinnes, and therfore thou art in the true diſpoſition which <hi>S.</hi> Auſtin thincketh ſufficient; yea, and in a more excellent, becauſe thou haſt not ſo much as an affection to ſinne venially: ſo that yf it pleaſe thy ghoſtly father, thou mayſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably communicate more often then euery ſunday.</p>

Yet many lawfull impediments may befall thee not of thine owne part, but of theirs with whome thou liueſt, which may giue occaſion to a ſage and diſcreet conductour, to forbid thee to communicate ſo often. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, yf thou liue in any kind of ſubiection, and thoſe to whome thou oweſt this ſubiection, reuerence, or obedience, be ſo ill inſtructed in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the ſoule, or ſo wayward, that they be troubled, or diſquieted to ſee thee communicate ſo often: peraduenture, all things well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it would be good to condiſcend to theſe mens infirmitie, and ſo to communicate but once euerie fifteen dayes; when thou canſt by no meanes ouercome this difficultie of theſe mens opinion. In a word it is hard to giue a generall rule in this caſe: the ſureſt is to remitt it allways to our ghoſtlie fathers aduiſe; though I thinck I may boldlie ſay, that the greateſt diſtance between the times of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating, among ſuch as deſire to ſerue God deuoutlie, is from month to month.</p>

               <p n="6">6. A word or two for married folke. In the ancient law, God would not haue the creditours exact that which was owing vnto them, vpon feaſts and holydayes, but he forbad not debtours to pay and reſtore that which they ought, to ſuch as demaunded it. It is an vndecencie, though no great

Yf thou cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to awake in the night time, by &amp; by fill thy hart, &amp; thy mouth with ſome deuout wordes, which like ſweet odours, may perfume thy ſoule, as it we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, to receaue thy ſpouſe: who watching whilſt thou ſleepeſt, prepareth him ſelf, to bring thee a thouſand gracious fauours, yf on thy part thou diſpoſe thy ſelf to receaue them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the morning get vp with great ioye, for the happineſſe which thou ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt to participate: and being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſt, go with great confidence, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:5901:109"/> great humilitie, to receaue this heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly food, which nourisheth thee to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall life. After thou haſt recited the ſacred words, <hi>O Lord I am not worthy,</hi> moue not thy head or lippes any more, neither to pray, nor yet to ſighe, but opening thy mouth handſomly, and lifting vp thy head as much as is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that the prieſt may ſee what he doth, full of hope, faith, and charitie, receaue him, in whome, by whome, and for whome, thou beleeueſt, hopeſt, and loueſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. O Philotheee, thinck with thy ſelf, that as the Bee gathering from flowers the dew of heauen, and choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt iuice vpon the earth, conuerteth it into honny, and carieth it into her hiue: iuſt ſo the prieſt, taking the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueour of the world from the altar, true Sonne of God, as dewe come from heauen, and true Sonne of the Virgin, like a flower ſprong from the earth of our humanitie, conuerteth him into delightfull meate, in thy mouth, and in thy bodie.

To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, doe him all reuerence poſſible, and carie thy ſelf with ſuch behaueour, that men way iudge by thy actions, that God is within thee.</p>

               <p n="5">5. Thy principall intent in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating muſt be, to aduance, comfort, and ſtrengthen thy ſelf in the loue of God.

Yf worldlings demaund of thee, why thou communicateſt ſo often? tell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou doeſt it, to learne to loue God, to be purified from thy imperfections, to be deliuered from thy miſeries, to be comforted in thy afflictions, and to find reſt, repoſe, and eaſe in thy weaknes. Tell them, that two ſortes of perſons, should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate very often: the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, becauſe being well diſpoſed, they should do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues wrong, in not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to the wellſpring and ſource it ſelf of perfection: the imperfect, that they might with better reaſon and title aſpire to perfection; the ſtrong leaſt they become feeble, and the feeble to become ſtrong; the ſick to be healed, and the healthie, leaſt they fall into ſicknes. Tell them, that for thy owne part, as one very vnperfect, feeble, and ſick, thou haſt great need to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate often with him, who is thy only perfection, ſtrength, and health. Tell them, ſuch as haue not many worldlie affaires, should communicate often, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue good leaſure: and ſuch as haue many temporall occupations,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:5901:110"/> should likewiſe ſo do, becauſe they haue need: and that he that laboureth much and taketh great paines, muſt vſe often to eate, and ſtrengthen him ſelfe with hartie meat. Tell them, that thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueſt the bleſſed Sacrament, to learne to receaue it well: for no man can do an action well, which he hath not often practized.</p>
               <p n="7">7.

               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE king of the Bees neuer goeth a progreſſe into the fields, but enuironned with all his litle people: and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie neuer entreth into the hart of man, but she lodgeth with her, all the whole traine of other virtues, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and ſetting them a worke, as a
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:5901:111"/> Captaine doth his ſoldiours. But she ſetteth them a worke, neither all at once, nor all alike, nor in all ſeaſons, nor in euery place: for the iuſt man is like a tree planted vpon the water ſide, which bringeth foorth fruit in due ſeaſon: and charitie as it were watring the ſoule, bringeth foorth in her the actions and workes of virtue, euery one in their proper time. <hi>Musick, being ſo pleaſaunt a thing in it ſelf, is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom in time of mourning,</hi> ſaith the prouerb. It is a great fault in manie, who vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the exerciſe of ſome particular virtue, enforce them ſelues to practiſe the acts therof, at euery encounter and in all occurences, imitating the ancient philoſophers Democritus and Heracly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, alway laughing, or alway weeping; and (which is yet worſe) blaming and cenſuring ſuch, as do not always exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the ſelf ſame virtues. One muſt reioice with the ioyfull, and weep with the ſorowfull, ſayth the Apoſtle: and charitie is patient, bountifull, liberall, diſcreet, and condeſcending or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating it ſelfe, to all occaſions, and exigences of our brethren.</p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:5901:112"/>
               <p n="2">2. There are notwithſtanding ſome virtues, whoſe vſe is almoſt vniuerſall, and muſt not worke their actions only ſeuerally and a part, but muſt ſpread and extend them amid the qualities and operations of all other virtues. Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are ſeldome preſented to exerciſe the virtues of fortitude, magnanimitie and magnificence: but meeknes, mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dnes, temperance, modeſtie, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, are virtues, with which all the actions of our life, should be died and coloured. Many virtues may be more excellent then this one, but the vſe of this one may be more neceſſarie. Sugar is of more excellence then ſalt, but ſalt is more often and generallie vſed. We muſt allways therfore haue good ſtore, and readie prouiſion of theſe generall and common virtues, ſince the vſe of them is ſo ordinarie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Among the virtues which we would exerciſe, we muſt preferre that, which is moſt conformable to our calling, not that which is moſt agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our owne taſt and will. Sainct Paula delighted in the exerciſe of aſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and corporall mortifications,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:5901:112"/> that ſo she might more eaſilie enioy the ſweet tranquillitie of the ſpirit: but she had more obligation to obey her ſuperiours, then to ſeeke her owne contentment; and therefore <hi>S.</hi> Hierom amid her commendations ſayth, that in this she was to be reprehended, that she vſed immoderate abſtine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, againſt her Bishops aduice. The Apoſtles on the other ſide, appointed by God to preach the ghoſpel, and diſtribute the bread of heauen to hungrie ſoules, iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged exceeding well, that they should do wrong to this great function of theirs, yf they should employ their time, in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing &amp; looking to the poore, although to do ſo, were the act of an excellent virtue. Euery calling and vocation ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in neede of the practiſe of ſome peculiar virtue. Difference is there, between the vertue of a Prelat, and of a prince, or a ſoldiour: the virtue of a married man, is different from the virtues of a widow: and although euery man should be endowed with all virtues, euery one notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, is not bound to practiſe them alike, but each one muſt giue him ſelfe
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:5901:113"/> in more particular manner, to thoſe virtues that belong to that kind of life where vnto he is called.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Of the virtues which appertaine not peculiarly to our particular eſtate, and dutie, we muſt preferre thoſe which are moſt excellent in deed, not thoſe which excell only in appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Blazing ſtarres ordinarilie, ſeeme greater and goodlier the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the verie ſtarres of heauen, and occupie much more place, at leaſt wiſe in our eyes; wheras in deed they are neither in greatnes, not in qualitie, and influence, comparable to the ſtarres of the skie; neither ſeeme they great for any other reaſon, but becauſe they are neerer vnto vs, and in a more groſſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect in reſpect of the ſtarres. There are likewiſe certaine virtues, which becauſe they are neerer to our ſenſes, and (yf I may ſay ſo) ſomwhat material, are highly eſteemed by the vulgar people: for ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly they preferre corporall almes, before the ſpirituall workes of mercy: haircloth faſting, nakednes, diſciplins, and other ſuch bodilie mortifications, before meekenes, courteſie, modeſtie, and other mortifications of the mind,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:5901:113"/> which notwithſtanding in true iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cenſure, are much more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. Chooſe then, Philotheus, thoſe virtues which are beſt, not thoſe which are only eſteemed ſo by the vnskilfull vulgar; thoſe which are more excellent, not thoſe which are more apparent; the ſubſtantial'ſt, not the braueſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is exceeding profitable, that euery man should make choice of ſome particular virtue, not neglecting or abandoning the reſt, but procuring to be moſt conuerſant, in the exerciſe of ſome one peculiar virtue, to which he thincks him ſelf moſt apte, all things well conſidered.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A beautifull damoſell shining like the ſunne, royally adorned, and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wth a garland of oliues, appee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a viſion to <hi>S.</hi> Iohn Bishop of Alexandria, and ſayd vnto him: I am the kings eldeſt daughter, yf thou canſt gaine my good will, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct thee to his preſence. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued that this was Mercy, towards the poore, which God commanded vnto him by this viſion: and therfore euer after, he gaue him ſelfe in ſuch
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:5901:114"/> ſort to the exerciſe of the workes of mercie, that he is now commonlie called amongſt all <hi>S.</hi> Iohn the Almner.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Eulogius of Alexandria, deſiring to do ſome peculiar ſeruice, to the honour of God, and being not able to embrace a ſolitary eremiticall life, or to reſigne him ſelf vp to the obedience of of an other, took vnto him in his houſe a miſerable perſon, all infected with leaproſy, to exerciſe his charitie and mortification vpon him; and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this with more perfection, he made a vow to entertaine him, honour, and ſerue him, as any ſeruant doth his Lord and maiſter. Now vpon ſome tentation happening, as well to the lazar, as to Eulogius, to depart one from the other, they went vnto greate Saint Anthony for his councell. Who ſayd vnto them. Beware my children, that you ſeparate not your ſelues one from the other, for both of you, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching nigh to your end, yf the Angels find you not together, you are in great dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of leeſing your crownes.</p>

Tobias exerciſed his charitie in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riyng the dead: <hi>S.</hi> Eliſabeth, as great a princeſſe as she was, delighted ſo much in nothing, as in the abiecting and aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of her ſelfe. <hi>S.</hi> Catherin of Genua in her widowhood, dedicated her ſelfe to ſerue an hoſpitall. Caſſianus recounteth, that a deuoute gentlewoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſirous to exerciſe the virtue of patience, came to <hi>S.</hi> Athanaſius, who at her requeſt, placed a poore widow with her, ſo wayward, cholerick, troubleſome, &amp; intolerable, that she gaue the deuout dame, matter and occaſion enough, to practize the virtue of meeknes and ſufferaunce.</p>

Finally among the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God, ſome applie them ſelues principallie to attend and viſit the ſick; others with almes and fauour, ſuccour the needie and poore; others procure to inſtruct litle children, in the neceſſary know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſtian doctrine; others endeuour to recall home to God and his church, ſoules that are loſt and gone aſtray; others ſolace them ſelues in adorning churches, and decking the holy altars; others to make peace and agreement, amongſt ſuch as are fallen at ſtrife and variaunce. Wherein they imitate skilfull imbroderers, who vpon diuers grounds, with admirable varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, entermingle ſilk, ſiluer, and gold twiſts, wherof they drawe ſondrie ſorts of flowers: and ſo theſe godly ſoules, vndertaking ſome particular exerciſe of deuotion, do make it ſerue them, as a groundwork of their ſpirituall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyderie, vpon which they work the varietie of all other virtues: holding by that meanes all their actions and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, better vnited and ordered, by the carefull application of them to their principall exerciſe, and in this,

               <p n="6">6. When we are afflicted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batted by any kind of vice, it behoueth vs, as much as it lieth in vs, to giue our ſelues wholly to the practize of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie virtue, and to order and applie all other virtues, to the perfecting of that particular virtue. For ſo we shall ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the enemie againſt which we fight, &amp; aduance our ſelues likewiſe in other virtues. If I feel my ſelf impugned with pride, or choler, in all my actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s I will bend my ſelf to the contrarie ſide, that is to humilitie, and meeknes: and to obtaine that virtue I will applie all my other exerciſes of prayer, receauing the ſacraments, of prudence, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, ſobrietie and the reſt. For as the wild Boares to sharpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their tuskes, do ſcoure and whet them with their other teeth, ſo that all of them do

Yea oft times it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth (as <hi>S.</hi> Gregory Nazianzen ſayth) that by one onely act of ſome virtue, well and perfectly performed, a man may attaine to the hight of virtue: and he alleadgeth in proofe of this ſaying, the example of Rahab, who hauing exactly practized the virtue of hoſpitalitie, attained vnto a glorious ſoueraignty in holines. Which is to be vnderſtood, when ſuch acts are practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, with excellent feruour of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>

I meane thoſe perfections, which are called extaſies, rauis ments in ſpirit, inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, languishments, or impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of exteriour actions, deificall vnions, eleuations, transformations of the ſoule, and ſuch like; of which
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:5901:118"/> ſome bookes do treat, promiſing to eleuate and promote the ſoule to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, purely intellectual, to the eſſentiall application of the ſpirit, and of the ſupereminent life of the ſoule. Mark me well what I ſay, my Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus, theſe perfections, be not virtues, but rather rewardes and recompences, that God giueth his ſeruants in this life for their virtues: or as it were ſcantlings, and liſtes, of the happines of the life to come, which ſomtime are preſented vnto men, to make them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to buy the whole peeces them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, which are aboue in Paradiſe. We muſt not pretend to come vnto-ſuch high fauours and graces, ſince they are not any wiſe neceſſarie to ſerue and loue God well and truly, which should be our chief and only pretence: Neither are they graces which may ordinarilie be obtained, by our owne trauell or induſtrie, ſince they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſions, then actions, which therfore we may well receaue, but worke them or produce them in vs, we can not. I adde more ouer that we haue not vndertooke any higher
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:5901:118"/> matter, then to make our ſelues vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, deuout, and good men and good wemen: and therfore it behoueth vs to beſtow all our endeuour to that end; and if it pleaſe God to eleuate &amp; extoll vs to theſe Angelicall perfections, we shalbe then alſo good Angels: but in the meane time, let vs exerciſe our ſelues ſimply, humbly, and deuoutly in theſe lower humane virtues, the conqueſt and gaining of which, our Saueour hath left to our owne power and diligence; ſuch as are the virtues of patience, courteſie, meeknes, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of our harts, and willes, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, obedience, pouertie, chaſtyty, compaſſion towards our neighbours, and bearing with their imperfections, diligence, and holy feruour in fulfilling the will of God. Let vs leaue theſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminences, for ſuperexcellent ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, we merit not ſo high a place in Gods ſeruice; it wilbe happines for vs, to ſerue our God, in his kitchin (as they ſay) or in his pantrie, to be lackies, porters, torche-bearers, groomes of the chamber, in his houſe. It is his mercy and ineſtimable goodnes only, if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:5901:119"/> he pleaſe to remoue vs higher to his cloſet, and priuie chamber, or to be of his councell. Yea, my Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus, this muſt be the reſignation of our hart; for this king of glory, doth recompence his ſeruants, not according to the dignitie of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which they beare vnder him, but according to the meaſure of the loue and humilitie, with which they execute them. Saul ſeeking after his fathers Aſſes, found the crowne and kingdome of Iſrael. Rebecca by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring Abrahams Camels, became the eſpouſe of his ſonne Iſaac. Ruth, the Moabiteſſe, gleaning after the harueſt men of Boos, and lying at his feete, was exalted to lie by his ſide, and made his wedded wife. Surely the pretentions and deſires of ſuch loftie, extraordinary, and admirable things, are obnoxious and ſubiect vnto il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, deceipts, and errours; and it chaunceth oft times, that theſe ſublimated perſons, that thinck them ſelues Angels, are ſcantly ſo much as good men, and that there is more excellence and ſublimitie in theire
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:5901:119"/> wordes, and rare termes, then fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ſubſtance, in theire workes and actions. Yet muſt we not lightly diſpraiſe, or rashly cenſure any thing, but bleſſing God for the ſuperemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of other men, reſt our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues humbly in this low, plaine, and eaſie way, which is indeed more plaine, but yet more ſecure; leſſe excellent, but yet more ſuteable to our inſufficiency and weaknes: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if we conuerſe humbly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, God will lift vs vp to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, great enough for our ſoules good.</p>

               <p n="1">1. PATIENCE <hi>is neceſſary for you, that performing the will of God, you may obtaine the promiſe,</hi> ſayth the Apoſtle: yea, for as our Lord him ſelf pronounced, <hi>In your patience you shall poſſeſſe your ſoules.</hi> It is the happieſt thing that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> befall to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (Philotheus) to haue
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:5901:120"/> his owne ſoule in ſure and ſecure poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion: and the more perfect that our patience is, the more ſecure is the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of our ſoules: we muſt endeuour then to perfect this virtue in vs, to the vttermoſt of our power. Call to mind continually, that our bleſſed Redeemer faued vs, by ſuffering and enduring: and that we therfore in like manner, muſt work our ſaluation, by ſuffering afflictions, and enduring iniuries, and bearing contradictions, and diſpleaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, with the greateſt meeknes that poſſible we can.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Limit not thy patience, to ſuch and ſuch kind of iniuries, and afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: but extend it magnanimouſly and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally, to all thoſe that God shal ſend, and ſuffer to befall thee. There be ſome men that will ſuffer no tribulations, but ſuch as be honourable: As for example, to be wounded in battaile, to be taken priſoner in warre, to be perſequuted, and ill handled, for religion ſake, to be impouerished by ſome ſute or proceſſe, in which they haue gott the vpper hand: theſe men loue not tribulation, but the honour which the tribulation
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:5901:120"/> bringeth. He that is patient in deed, and a true ſeruant of God. Suffereth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently thoſe tribulations, that are coupled with infamie and shame, as well as thoſe that be honourable. To be reprehended, accuſed, ſlandered by naughtie and wicked men, is a pleaſure to a man of courage: but to ſuffer theſe accuſations and perſequutions at the hands of our parents and frinds, and of ſuch as are good and virtuous, and eſteemed ſo, there is the right triall of true patience, there it is in deed, that we muſt play the men. I eſteeme more of the meeknes, wherwith the bleſſed Cardinal Borromaeus, ſuffered a long time the publique reprehenſions, which a great preacher of an order, exceedin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glie well reformed, thundered againſt him out of the pulpit: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats which he had with any other. For like as the ſtinging of a Bee, is farre ſorer and fulle of ache, then the byting of a flye: ſo the euil that one receaueth of good men, and the contradictions that they raiſe againſt one, are much more vnſupportable then others; and yet it chanceth very often, that two
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:5901:121"/> good and virtuous men, hauing both of them right intentions, through diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of opinions, do ſtirre vp great perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quutions &amp; contradictions, one againſt the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be patient, not onely in the great, and principall afflictions which arriue vnto thee, but allſo in the acceſſories and accidents which depend thereon. Many could be content to haue affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions happen vnto them, ſo that they might not be hurt, troubled or vexed by them. I am not grieued ſayth one, that I am fallen into pouertie, but that by that meanes I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not pleaſure my frinds, nor bring vp my children in ſuch hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable education as I deſire. I care not (ſayth another) were it not that the world will thinck, that this is befallen me by mine owne fault. Another would be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent ſome should ſpeak ill of him, and would ſuffer it patiently, ſo that no man would beleeue the detractour. Others there are, that could willingly away with ſome part of the tribulation, as they ſuppoſe, but not with the whole. They are not impatient, or vexed (ſay they) that they are ſick: but that they
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:5901:121"/> want mony to cure them ſelues of their ſicknes, or that they that be about them, are too importunat and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to them. But I ſay (my Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus) that we muſt haue patience, not only to be ſick, but euen to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited with that diſeaſe that God will lay vpon vs, what euer it be, and in that place wherſoeuer he will haue it happen to vs, and amongſt ſuch perſons, and with thoſe wants and incommodities, which he will; and the like is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of all other tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. When any damage or harme shall chaunce vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, oppoſe againſt it a Gods name, thoſe remedies which thou ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt applie, for to do otherwiſe, were to tempt God almightie: but hauing done thy dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce in the matter, attend with an entire reſignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ſucceſſe &amp; euent, which it shall pleaſe God to ſend: if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt the remedies to ouercome thy harmes, giue him thancks with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, if it pleaſe him that thy harmes ſurmount the remedies, bleſſe him with patience.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I am of the aduice of Saint Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory. When thou art iuſtly accuſed
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:5901:122"/> for any fault which thou haſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, humble thy ſelf for it, and confeſſe vnfainedlie, that thou deſerueſt more then the accuſation that is layd againſt thee. But yf thou be accuſed falſly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe thy ſelf with all meeknes, denying thy ſelf to be guiltie of that which is layd to thy charge, for thou oweſt that dutie to the truth, and to the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy neighbour; But withall, yf after thy true and lawfull diſcharge, men co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue notwithſtanding their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation againſt thee, ſtriue not much to make thy excuſe be admitted and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, for hauing complied with the dutie thou oweſt vnto the truth, thou muſt render alſo the dutie thou oweſt to humilitie. Thus thou shalt neither offend, againſt the care that thou oughteſt to haue of thy good renowne, nor againſt the loue and affection, which thou shouldſt haue to tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of hart, meeknes, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Complaine as litle as thou canſt of the wrongs that be done thee; for ordinarilie he that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaineth of them, ſinneth: becauſe ſelf loue alway maketh
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:5901:122"/> vs beleeue the iniuries offered vs, to be worſe then indeed they be. But aboue all things complaine not to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as are apt to take indignation, and to turne all to the worſt. Yf it be expedient to make thy mone to any, either to get the offence remedied, or thy mind eaſed, let it be done to quiet &amp; peaceable ſoules, that loue God ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relie; for otherwiſe, inſteed of eaſing and diſcharging thy griefs, they will prouoke thee to greater diſquiet: in ſteed of pulling out the thorne that pricketh thee, they will faſten and ſlick it deeper into thy foote.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Manie being ſick, afflicted, or moleſted, refraine them ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, or shewing any delicatenes, iudging (&amp; that rightlie) that it would euidentlie teſtifie want of courage and generoſitie in them: but for all that, they deſire exceedingly, and by ſlights and ſubtilities procure, that other men bemone them, take co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion of them, and eſteeme them to be not onlie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, but patient, yea, and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous alſo in their afflictions. This is a kind of patience indeed, but a falſe
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:5901:123"/> one, which in effect, is nothing elſe but a fine ſubtil and ſecret pride and vanitie: <hi>They haue glorie</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>but not before God.</hi> The true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient man, neither complaineth of his griefs and harmes, nor deſireth to be pittied and bemoned: he ſpeaketh of his caſe cleerly, truly, and ſimplie, without lamentations, or aggrauations: yf he be pittied, he thancketh God for the charitie and comfort shewed him, and patientlie ſuffereth him ſelf to be pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, vnleſſe they bemone the harme or euil, which he hath not: for then will he modeſtly declare, that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth no ſuch grief, as they imagin; and in this ſort continueth peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, betwixt truth and patience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, not complaining of his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In the contradictions which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall thee in the exerciſe of deuotion, (for they will not be lacking one ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me or other) remember the words of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt: <hi>A woman when she is in trauail, hath anguish becauſe her hour is come: but when she hath brought foorth her child, then she remembreth not
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:5901:123"/> the anguishe, for ioy that a man is borne into the world.</hi> Thou conceiueſt ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuallie in thy ſoule the nobleſt child in the world, to wit, Ieſus Chriſt; vntill he be brought foorth altogether, thou canſt not chooſe but ſuffer exceſſiue pangs: but be of a good hart, theſe dolours once paſt, thou shalt find euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ioye, for hauing brought foorth ſuch a child to the world. And he shalbe whollie brought foorth and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in thee, when thou frameſt, and conformeſt thy hart and thy actions, to the imitation of his life.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When thou art ſick offer vp all thy griefs, paines, aches, &amp; languishments, to the honour and ſeruice of our Lord: and beſeech him to ioine &amp; vnite them with the torments which he ſuffered for thee. Obey thy phyſician, take thoſe medicines, meats and remedies which he preſcribeth, for the loue of God, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to mind the gall which he taſted for our ſakes: deſire to amend, that thou mayſt ſerue him; refuſe not to la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guishe, that thou mayſt obey him: and diſpoſe thy ſelf to die (yf ſo it pleaſe him) that thou mayſt prayſe and enioy him. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:5901:124"/> that the Bees whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they make their hunny, do liue and eate of a bitter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion: and that we in like manner, can neuer exerciſe ſweeter acts of patience, nor compoſe more excellent hunny of true virtues, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when we eate the bread of bitternes, and liue in the middeſt of afflictions. And as the hunny which is gathered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thyme, a litle bitter herbe, is the beſt that is: ſo virtue exerciſed in the bitternes of vile, baſe, and moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect tribulations, is the fineſt and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenteſt of all.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Reflect often times the inward eyes of thy ſoule, vpon Chriſt Ieſus cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, naked, blaſphemed, ſlandred, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken for thy loue, and in a word, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with all ſortes of ſorowes, griefs, and perſequutions.

Euen ſo to know whether a man be in deed wiſe, learned, generous, noble, mark whether theſe good gifts and qualities tend in him to humilitie, modeſtie, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, for then they be true in deed: but if they ſwimme aboue water, if they ſtriue to appeare and shew them ſelues, they are ſo much the leſſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall, and more ſuperficiall, by how much more apparent they are, or would be. Pearles that be conceaued and grow in the wind, or in time of thunder, haue nothing but the barke, or shell of a pearle, and are voide of ſubſtance: ſo theſe virtues and good qualities bred and nourished in pride, boaſting, and vanitie, haue nothing but a ſimple shew and appearance of good, without iuice, without marrow, without ſoliditie and ſubſtance.

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:5901:127"/> as the knowledge of the infinite multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his benefits, neither can any thing ſo much humble vs before his iuſtice, as the multitude of our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Let vs then conſider what he hath done for vs, and what we haue done againſt him: and as we conſider and way our ſinnes one by one, ſo let vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge &amp; ſuruay his graces one by one. Neuer feare that the knowledge which he giues vs of his graces, will puffe vs vp in pride, ſo long as we be attentiue to this knowne and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged veritie, that whatſoeuer is good in vs, is altogether from God, and not from our ſelues. Alas, Mules and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, ceaſe they to be lumpishe and brute beaſts, though they be neuer ſo loaded with the pretious and perfumed moueables of the prince? <hi>What haſt thou which thou haſt not receaued?</hi> ſayth the Apoſtle; <hi>and yf thou haſt receaued it, why doeſt thou glorye?</hi> Nay contrariwiſe, the liuelie and feeling conſideration, of the fauours receaued from Gods hand, humbleth vs; becauſe knowledge en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geadreth acknowledgement.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But yf in this reuiew and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:5901:128"/> (as it were) of the graces of God, any kind of vanitie should tickle vs: the infallible, and eaſie remedie is, to paſſe by and by, to the conſideration of our ingratitude, of our imperfections, and of our miſeries; Yf we conſider what we haue done, when God was not with vs, we shall ſoone acknowledge, that all which we haue done, ſince he hath been with vs, is not our handy work, nor is not of our owne ſtock; we shall enioy them, and reioice that we haue them, but we shall glorifie God alone, for being the ſole auth our and giuer of them. So the bleſſed virgin, confeſſed and profeſſed, that God had wrought great and admirable things in her, and for her, but she confeſſed it for no other cauſe, then for to humble her ſelf, and to glorifie God: <hi>My ſoule</hi> (ſayth she) <hi>doth magnify our Lord, becauſe he hath done great things to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. We vſe to ſay manie times, that we are nothing, that we are miſerie it ſelf, that we are the skumme and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſts of the world: but we would be loath any man should take vs at our word, and publish vs abroad to be ſuch
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:5901:128"/> as we ſay we are: Nay we make as if we would hide our ſelues, to the end men may runne after vs, and ſearche vs out; we make show as yf we would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be the laſt, &amp; ſitt at the loueſt end of the table: but we do ſoe that with more credit we may be ſet at the vpper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end of all. True humilitie neuer she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth her ſelf, nor vſeth many words of humble ſound, becauſe she inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not onely to hide other virtues, but withall and aboue all, to hide her owne ſelf And yf it were lawfull for her to lie, to diſſemble, or ſcandalize her neighbour, she would vſe manie an action of arrogancie, and brauerie that vnder them she might hide her ſelfe, &amp; ſo be altogether couered &amp; vnknowne. My aduice therfore is this Philotheus, either let vs vſe no words of humilitie at all, or let vs vſe them with an inward feeling, meaning in our hart, as we pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with our mouth. Let vs neuer caſt our eyes downe to the ground, but humbling our harts with all: let vs not ſeeme to deſire the loweſt roome, vnleſſe we deſire it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our hart. And I hold this rule ſo general, that I bring no exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:5901:129"/> only I adde, that courteſie requireth, that we preſent the aduantage ſomtime to thoſe, whome we know manifeſtly will refuſe it: for this is no double dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, nor falſe humilitie, for in this caſe the only proffer of the aduantage in place, or precedence, or ſuch like, is an honouring of them to whome we prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it and ſince then, one cannot giue them entirely that which in hart we would, we do not ill to giue it them in part. The like I vnderſtand of ſome ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of honour, and reſpect, which (to examin them in rigour) ſeeme not to be true, &amp; yet are in deed true enough, yf the hart of him that pronounceth them, haue a true intention, to honour, and reſpect him, for whoſe ſake he vſeth thoſe tearmes. For although the words doe ſignifie with ſome exceſſe, that which we would ſay: yet it is not ill done to vſe them, when common cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of ciuilitie requireth it. I wishe that our wordes, were always ioined to our intention and affection, as neer as it is poſſible, ſo to follow in all, and through all, the pure and naked ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of a virtuous hart.</p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:5901:129"/>
               <p n="5">5. A man that is truly humble, would rather that another should ſay of him that he is a miſerable wretche, that he is nothing, nor worth nothing, then to ſay ſo much him ſelf: at leaſt, if he know that any man ſay ſo of him, he doth not gainſay it, but agreeth to it with all his hart: for ſince he beleeueth firmely &amp; vnfainedly, that he is in deed worth nothing, he is right glad to haue others of his mind and opinion.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Manie ſay that they leaue mentall prayer, for thoſe that are perfect, that they themſelues are not worthie to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſuch an exerciſe. Others proteſt they dare not communicate often, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they feele not them ſelues pure enough. Others that verely they feare leaſt they should diſgrace deuotion, if they should entermedle with it, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their great miſerie and frailtie: Others refuſe to employ their talent in the ſeruice of God, and of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, becauſe (ſay they) they knowe theire owne weaknes, and feeblenes: and that they feare to become proude, if they should be inſtruments of any good: &amp; that in giuing light to others,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:5901:130"/> they should conſume them ſelues. All this is an artificiall kind of humilitie, not only falſe, but alſo malignant, wherby one ſeeketh ſecretly and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly, to blame the guifts of God, or at the leaſt with the cloke of humilitie, to couer the loue of his owne humour and ſlothfulnes. <hi>Demaund of God a ſigne, either, from heauen aboue, or from the depth of the ſea below:</hi> ſayd the prophet to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie Achaz, and he anſwerd: <hi>I will demaund none, neither will I tempt God.</hi> O wicked man, he would ſeeme to beare great reuerence to God, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of humilitie, excuſeth him ſelf from aſpiring to the grace which Gods goodnes offereth vnto him: but he vnderſtood not, that when our Lord offereth vs his graces, it is pride to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe them; that the guifts of God, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge vs to receaue them, and that true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, is to obey and folow his will and deſire the neereſt we can. But Gods deſire is, that we become perfect, vniting our ſelues vnto him, and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him the beſt we can. The proud man which truſteth in him ſelf, hath iuſt occaſion (if he knew it) to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take

We muſt then humbly and holily dare and vndertake, what ſoeuer is iudged fit and conuenient to our ſpirituall aduancement, by them that haue the guiding of our ſoules.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To thinck one knoweth that, which he knoweth not, is an expreſſe follie: to play the learned man in that, in which it is manifeſt we haue no skill nor experience, is an intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vanitie. For my part, I would not take vpon me a learned mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, euen in things which I were certaine that I knew wel enough: as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariewiſe, I would not counterfet my ſelf altogether ignorant. When charitie requireth, we muſt readilie and ſweetlie
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:5901:131"/> communicate to our neighbour, not only that, which is neceſſarie for his inſtruction, but withall, that which is profitable for his conſolation: for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, which hideth and concealeth virtues, to conſerue them in their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, doth neuertheles diſcouer them, and make them shew them ſelues, when charitie commandeth, to increaſe and perfect them. Wherin she reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth a tree in the Iſles of Tylos, which all night long, locketh and encloſeth vp her faire carnation flowers, and doth not open them, but at the riſing of the ſunne, ſo that the inhabitants of the countrie do ſay, that theſe flowers do ſleep by night: for euen ſo humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, couereth and hideth all our virtues and humane perfections, and letteth them not be ſeene abroad, but when charitie commandeth: and charitie being a virtue not humane, but heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not moral but diuine, is the verie true ſunne of all other virtues, vpon which she muſt therfore euer predominate: ſo that humilitie which is preiudicious to charitie, is without all doubt falſe humilitie.</p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:5901:131"/>
               <p n="8">8. I would neither cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeit a foole, nor a wiſeman: for yf humilitie forbid me to counterfeit my ſelf wiſe, ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie and plainnes forbid me likewiſe, to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeit my ſelf a foole: for as vanitie and pride are contrarie to humilitie; ſo are affectation and diſſembling co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to ſimplicitie, and plaine-dealing. And yf ſome great ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God haue made as yf they had been fooles, to render them ſelues more abiect in the eyes of the worlde, we muſt admire them, and not imitate them: for they had motiues that induced them to this exceſſe, which were ſo peculiar vnto them, &amp; extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie, that no man ought from then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to inferre any conſequence for him ſelf. As for Dauid, when he daunced before the arke of the teſtament, with ſome more demonſtration of myrth, then ſeemed to beſeeme the maieſtie of a king, he did it not as counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faiting any foolish myrthe, but ſimplie and plainlie vſed he theſe exteriour mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, conformable to the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie gladnes which he felt in his hart. True it is, that when Michol his wife vp braided him for this fact, as to baſe
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:5901:132"/> and fond for a king, he was neuer a whit ſorrie to ſee himſelfe deſpiſed, but perſeuering in the true and ſincere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the ioye which he had conceiued in his ſoule, he proteſted that he was likewiſe glad to receaue a litle shame for the loue of his God. And conſequently I ſay, that yf for acts of true and profound deuotion, thou be eſteemed ſimple, abiect, and baſe-minded, humilitie will make thee reioyce at this happie shame, the cauſe wherof is not in thee, but in them that lay it vpon thee.</p>

            <div n="6" type="chapter">
               <head>That humilitie maketh vs loue our owne debaſement and abiection. CHAPTER 6.</head>
               <p n="1">1. I PASSE farther Philotheae, to tel thee, that aboue all things thou loue thy owne abiection. But thou wilt aske me, what it is to loue our owne abiection. In latin abiection is all one with humilitie, and humilitie with
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:5901:132"/> abiection: for ſo when our Ladie in her ſacred hymne, ſayth, that all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions should tearme her bleſſed, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe God had ſeene the humilitie of his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dmaide: her meaning is, that our Lord beheld with great loue her abiection, her baſenes, and lowneſſe, to endowe her with fauours &amp; ineſtimable graces. Yet there is great difference between the virtue of humilitie, and abiection: for abiection is the litlenes, baſenes, poornes, &amp; the nothing that is in vs of our owne ſelues, we not knowing nor conſidering it: but as for the virtue of humilitie, it is a true feeling knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, and voluntarie acknowledgement of our abiection and vileneſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the principall point of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie conſiſteth not only in this willing acknowledgement of our abiection, but to loue it, and take a delight and contentment in it: not for want of courage or magnanimitie, but to extoll ſo much the more the diuine maieſtie, and to eſteeme much better of our neighbour in compariſon of our ſelues. This point is that which I exhort thee to inſiſt in moſt of al:
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:5901:133"/> and that thou mayſt the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and conceiue it. Conſider that amongſt the afflictions and troubles which we ſuffer in this life, ſome of them be baſe, contemptible, and abiect, other be honourable, and glorious, and many applie them ſelues willinglie to honourable tribulations, but ſcarce any at all will abide thoſe that be abiect &amp; ignominious. So a deuout hermit all ragged, and shiuering for cold, euerie bodie honoureth his torne habit, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king compaſſion of that which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth: but yf a poore tradeſeman, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed gentleman, or a poore gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be in the ſame caſe, men deſpiſe and mock them: and ſo thou ſeeſt how their pouertie is abiect, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious. A religious man receaueth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly a rigorous reprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, and a child of his father, and all men count it and call it mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, obedience, and good manners: but let a knight, or ſome great ladie, ſuffer the like of another, and although they do it for the loue of God, men will call it cowardlineſſe, puſillanimitie, &amp; lack of courage: behold heere is another
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:5901:133"/> abiect euil. One hath a cancker on his arme, and another vpon his face: the firſt hath only the diſeaſe, which is bad enough; but this other iointly with the diſeaſe, hath contempt, shame, and abiection in all companie. What ſay I then of louing abiection? I ſay, that we muſt not only loue the harme it ſelf, which we do by the virtue of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience: but we muſt alſo loue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, the shame, the vilenes, baſenes, and abiection therof, which we doe by the virtue of humilitie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Againe there be ſome virtues, that ſeeme abiect and contemptible, other that are honorable and reſpected by all men. Patience, meeknes, plaindealing, ſimplicitie, &amp; humility it ſelf, are of the number of thoſe virtues, which worldly men hold as vile, and abiect: contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe they make great eſtimation of wiſdome, fortitude, and liberalitie. There be alſo diuerſe actions of the ſelf ſame virtue, wherof ſome be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, and others honorable; to giue almes, and to pardon iniuries and offences, are both of them acts proceeding from charitie: and the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:5901:134"/> firſt is honoured of all men, the laſt moſt baſe in the eyes of the blind world. A young gentleman or gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, that will not diſorder them ſelues, with a companie of diſſolute mates in prating, dauncing, drincking, ſuperfluous pompe, and curioſitie of apparell, shalbe ſcoffed at and cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by others, and their laudable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie, termed hypocriſie or affected ſanctitie: To loue theſe cenſures, to reioyce in that the world hath this opinion of vs, is to loue our owne abiection. Behold againe another ſort of abiection which we muſt loue. We goe to viſit the ſick, many of vs together: if I be ſent to the moſt miſcrable, that is to me an abiection in the iudgement of the world, and for that cauſe will I embrace it more willingly: but if I be ſent to viſit a perſon of more qualitie, it is an abiection according to iudgement of the ſpirit, for there is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſo much virtue nor merit, and therefore I will loue this abiection likewiſe. One falleth in the midſt of the ſtreet, and not only receaueth damage ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:5901:134"/> but is alſo shamfully laughed at: this is an abiection which we muſt make much of.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There are ſome defects alſo, which haue no other harme in them, but only the shame that they bring with them: and humilitie, though it require not that one should committ them of ſett purpoſes; yet it requireth that one diſquiet not him ſelf, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing fallen into ſome ſuch defect. Theſe defects which I now ſpeak of, be certaine fooleries, inciuilities, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate acts, or words, which as we ought to eſchew before they be committed, to obay ciuilitie and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: ſo when they are once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, we muſt be content with the reproache that commeth therby, and accept it willingly, that ſo we may folow the rule of holie humilitie. I ſay yet more: yf I chaunce to diſordre my ſelf through paſſion, or diſſolution, or to ſpeak ſome vndecent words, wher with God and my neighbour are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended: I will repent my ſelf harte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, with true ſorowe for the ſinne
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:5901:135"/> committed, and procure to repare the harme or offence done to my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the beſt that poſſible I can: but I will be content, and right glad, with the shame, contempt, and abiection which therby I haue incurred; and if the one could poſſibly be ſeparated from the other, I would ſincerely caſt away the ſinne, and earneſtly retaine the abiection.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But though we loue the abiection and contempt, which foloweth ſome euel or defect of ours: we muſt not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the redreſſe of the ill (that cauſed it) by conuenient and lawfull meanes, eſpecially, when the euil is of ſome conſequence and importance. As if I haue ſome deformed loathſome diſeaſe vpon my face, I will procure to haue it cured, but not to haue men forget the deformitie which it cauſed. Yf I haue committed ſome foolery, which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue to no man, I will not excuſe my ſelf at all: becauſe although it was a defect, and a fault, it is not perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and therfore it needeth no excuſe but onely for the abiection, shame, or contempt which befalls me for it,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:5901:135"/> and to excuſe that, is againſt humilitie. But if through my vnaduiſedneſſe and follie, I haue offended, or ſcandalized any man: I will make amends for the offence by ſome probable excuſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it containeth a permanent ill; and that charitie obligeth me to blot out and deface if I can.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To conclude it happeneth ſome times, that charitie commandeth vs to remedie and wipe away, the abiection &amp; contempt which we incurre, becauſe our reputation &amp; good name, is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for the edification of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. And in that caſe, though we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue abiection &amp; contempt, from our neighbours eyes, leaſt he should be ſcandalized or troubled therby: yet muſt we carefully lock it vp like a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Iewell in our hart, that we our ſelues may be edified therby.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Perchaunce thou wouldſt learne of me, Philotheus, which abiections amongſt all are to be eſteemed beſt? and I tell thee plainly in one word, that thoſe are moſt profitable to our ſoules, and moſt acceptable to God, which happen to vs as it were by chaunce, or
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:5901:136"/> by the courſe, condition and eſtate of our life, becauſe we chooſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, but receaue them only from the hands of God, that ſends them, whoſe ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and choice we know, is always better for vs, then our owne. But yf we were to chooſe them our ſelues, then the greateſt are the beſt for vs: and thoſe are to be eſteemed greateſt, which are moſt contrarie to our incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, (ſo that they be conformable to our vocation) for to ſpeak the truth once for all, our owne choice ſpoileth in a manner, and bringeth to naught all our virtues. O who will giue vs the grace, to ſay from our hart in all ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie with that great king: <hi>I haue made choice to be an abiect in the houſe of God, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to dwell in the tabernacles of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?</hi> None certainly can giue vs this grace (deare Philothee) but he that to exalt vs, liued and died for vs in ſuch manner, that he was eſteemed the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt of men, and the moſt abiect of the people.</p>
               <p>I haue told thee many things Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus, which no doubt will ſeeme ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hard vnto thee when thou conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt

So that honours and prayſes, are as it were pretious ſtones and pearles, from

Againe, as the leaues of trees, though in them ſelues of no great valew, yet ſerue for very much, not onely to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the trees, but alſo for the conſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their fruicts, whilſt they be yet young and tender: ſo good renowne, of it ſelf not much to be deſired, is not with ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding exceeding profitable, both for the ornament of our life, as alſo for the garde and conſeruation of our vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, eſpecially while they be yet tender and feeble, as being but newlie habitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in vs. The obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of maintaining our reputation, and of procuring to be ſuch in deed, as men thinck vs to be, forceth a noble courage, in a manner, with a ſweet king of violence. Let vs conſerue our virtues my Philotheus, as iewels very acceptable to God, the chief and ſoueraigne obiect of all our actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; But as they that would keep fruict very long, are not content to ſtew, confit, and conſerue them with ſugar, but with all put them into veſſels, fit and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious for the preſeruation of them: ſo albeit the loue of God be the principall
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:5901:138"/> preſeruer of our virtues, yet may we with all imploye our good name and renowne, as a thing moſt conuenient to keep them in vigour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet muſt we not be ouer-pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, nor too curious and exact in conſeruation of our reputation: for ſuch as be ſo tender and ticklish in their good name, are like vnto them, that for euerie ſlight infirmitie do take phyſick. For as theſe imagining by ſuch extraordinarie care, to conſerue their health, do vtterly ouerthrow it: ſo theſe iealous defenders of their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do altogether looſe it by ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo much vpon it, becoming ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore phantaſticall, murmurours, pick-quatrells, and prouoke the malice of bad tongues againſt them. To diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an iniurie offered, or to contemne it, is ordinarily a farre better remedie, then the reuenging or quarrelling vpon it, for contempt of calumniations, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them vanishe away: wheras yf we be moued and angred with them, we ſeeme to confeſſe and aduow them as deſeruedly offered vs. Crocodiles hurt none but thoſe that do feare them: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:5901:138"/> doth detraction endamage anie, but ſuch as are aggrieued therwith. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue feare of looſing our eſtimation, argueth great diſtruſt of the true foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation therof, which is the ſinceritie and vnfained vprightnes of a virtuous life, and good conſcience. Townes that haue woodden bridges ouer great riuers, doe feare leaſt they should be borne downe by euerie flood, or encreaſe of waters: but they that haue bridges built of ſtone, do not care but only for extraordinarie inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: So they that haue a ſoule well grounded in Chriſtian perfection, doe contemne the ordinarie exceſſe and ouerflowing of iniurious ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues; but ſuch as knowe them ſelues weake in perfection, are diſquieted with euery blaſt of broad-mouthed companions. And indeed (Philotheus) he that will haue the good opinion of all men, looſeth it with all men, ſince it is impoſſible to pleaſe all men with one manner of carriage; and he deſerueth to looſe his reputation, that ſeeks to keep it, or haue it among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whoſe vices make them infamous.</p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:5901:139"/>
               <p n="4">4. Reputation and good renowne, is but a ſigne wherby we may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand where virtue is lodged, it is virtue then that muſt be preferred before all. Wherfore yf any call and count thee an hypocrite, becauſe thou giueſt thy ſelf to deuotion; or hold thee for a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and baſe-minded perſon, becauſe thou haſt put vp an iniurie for Gods ſake: laugh at ſuch mens words and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; for beſide that ſuch iudgements are only made by fooles, contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible ideots, or vanie braggars, a man muſt not forſake virtue, nor ſtirre out of the path of true pietie, although he should looſe his reputation and fame; we muſt make more eſteeme of fruict, then of leaues, and preferre interiour and ſpirituall virtues, before externall and corporall goods. It is lawfull to be zelous, but not to be idolaters of our credit; as we muſt not offend the eyes of the good, ſo muſt we not ſeeke to content the opinion of the malitious. The beard is an ornament to the face of euerie man, and large treſſes of haire grace wemens heads: yf one pull away by the rootes (as it vere) the beard from
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:5901:139"/> the chinne, or the heare from the head, it will very hardly grow againe: but if it be onely cut and polled, nay though it should be shaued away all together, it would ſoone growe againe, and wax as copious as it was before. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our credit and reputation be cut and shauen, as a man may ſay, by a detracting tongue (which Dauid ſaith is like to a <hi>sharpe razour</hi>) we muſt not therfore be diſquieted, for by and by it will ſpring foorth againe, not only as faire as euer it was, but much more found and beautifull. But yf our vices, diſſolute manners, and wicked life, take our reputation from vs, it will ſcarce grow againe, or be reſtored entirely, becauſe it is ſo in a manner pulled vp by the roote. For the roote of true repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is virtue and good life, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as long as that is aliue in vs, our fame and credit will allways ſprout and growe, and bring foorth fruit of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and eſtimation, due to virtue. When vaine conuerſation, vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble familiarity, fond frindship, &amp; haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of idle companie, hurt our reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: we muſt preſently renounce and
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:5901:140"/> forſake them, for a good name is of more price and valew then all vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments and paſſe times; But yf for the exerciſe of pietie, for profit and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in virtue and deuotion, for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching cheerfullie towards eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, men grumble, repine, murmur, and cauill at vs: then ſuffer theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiues to bark againſt the moone, for though they may be able for a time, or among ſone men, to raiſe an ill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion againſt our good name, and by that meanes as it were shaue and polle away that ornament of our virtues; they will notwithſtanding ſpring vp againe as abundantly as before, and the razour of theſe malicious back biting tongues, wilbe to our credit, as the gardeners hook to the vine; which by cutting of leaues, and pruning ſome ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches, makes it become more fructifull.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let vs fixe our eyes alway vpon our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt crucified for vs, and marche on confidently in his ſeruice, ſimplie and plainlie, yet pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlie and diſcreetlie: and he wilbe the protectour of our reputation; yf
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:5901:140"/> he ſuffer it to be taken from vs; it is either to honour vs with a farre more glorious renowne, or at leaſt wiſe to make vs profit in the exerciſe of holy humilitie, wherof one onely ounce, is better then a thouſand pounds of honours and eſtimations. Yf we be vniuſtlie defamed, let vs meekly and quietly oppoſe the plaine truth againſt falſe calummation: yf then neuer the leſſe cauills perſeuer, let vs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe perſeuer in humbling our ſelues, reſigning our reputation, together with our ſoule into Gods hands, we cannot place it in better ſecuritie; Let vs ſetue God in infamie or good fame, according to ſaint Paules ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that we may ſay to God with Dauid, for thee (ô Lord) haue I ſuffered shame, and confuſion hath couered my face. I except neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe certaine enormious crimes, ſo infamous, that no man ought to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre him ſelfe to be falſelie charged with them: when he can lawfullie diſprooue the defamers; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine perſons likewiſe, vpon whoſe reputation and credit the edification

THE holy, Chriſme which by apoſtolicall tradition we vſe in the churche of God for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and conſecrations, is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of oile of Oliues, mingled with Baulme: which beſide other things, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth vnto vs, the two deere and louely virtues which shined in the ſacred perſon of our Lord, and which he moſt particularly did comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnto vs, as yf by them our hart were eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be conſecrated to his ſeruice, and applied to his imitation: <hi>Learne of me</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>for I am meek &amp; humble of hart.</hi> Humilitie perfecteth vs to Godward, and mildnes, or meeknes towards our neighbour.

               <p n="2">2. But take heede, Philotheus, that this myſticall Chriſme, compoſed of meekenes &amp; humilitie be indeed with in thy hart, for it is one of the greateſt ſubtilities of the deuil, to make many a man verie cnriouſly ſtudie, to make a shew of theſe two virtues in words and exteriour complements, who not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming throughly their inward affections eſteeme them ſelues humble and meek, where as in deed they be nothing ſoe; which we may well perceaue, becauſe for all their ceremonious mildnes and humilitie, at the leaſt croſſe word gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them, at the verie leaſt iniurie prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them, they puffe and ſwell like toades, with meruailous arrogancie and

But yf being ſtung and bitt by the ſlanderous and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious tongues of our enemies, we ſwell with fiercenes, ſpite, and rage: it is an euident ſigne, that our humilitie and meeknes, is not franck and free, but artificiallie counterfetted.</p>

               <p n="4">4. We muſt indeed reſiſt the euil, and ſuppreſſe the vices of them that are vnder our charge, conſtantly and ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but yet mildly, and peaceablie. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo ſoone tameth the Elephant being angred, then the ſight of a litle lambe: nothing breaketh ſo eaſilie the force of canon short, as ſoft wooll: we eſteeme not ſo much the correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that proceeds from paſſion, though it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pained with neuer ſo much reaſon, as that which hath no other cauſe or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning but reaſon.

               <p n="5">5. Better it is (ſayth the ſame glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Saint writing to his frind Profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns) to denie the entrie to anger, be it

It is better then and eaſier, to learne and accuſtom our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, to liue without choler, then to vſe our choler and anger moderatly, and diſcreetly. But yf through imperfection and frailtie, we find our ſelues ſurpriſed and ouertaken therwith, it is better to chace it away ſpeedelie, then to ſtand dalliyng and as it were copning with it. For giue it neuer ſo litle leaue, and it wilbe miſtreſſe of the fort, and like the ſerpent, which can eaſilie draw in his whole bodie, where he can once get

               <p n="6">6. But thou wilt ſay, how shall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and refraine my anger once hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and inflamed? Thou muſt Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus, at the firſt aſſault of choler, ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie aſſemble thy forces together, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting vpon that which thou haſt in hand, not rudely nor violently, but mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly and gentlie, though ſeriouſly and in all earneſt. For as wee ſee in the audien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; aſſemblies of the ſenats or courts, the vshers, with criyng of peace, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke more noiſe a great deale, then thoſe whome they bid to be ſilent: ſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth manie times, that endeuouring with impetuoſitie and manie force to aſſwage our choler, we ſtirre vp more perturbation and trouble in our ſelues, then the motion it ſelf of choler had done before, ſo that the hart being thus troubled, is no more maiſter of itſelf.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Secondly after this ſoft and ſweet ſtraining of thy powers, to reflect vpon them ſelues, practize the aduice which <hi>S.</hi> Auſtin being now old, gaue vnto the young bishop Auxilius.

I meane, that we should inuoke the aſſiſtance of God, when we perceaue our ſelues shaken with choler; imitating the Apoſtles, when they were toſſed with winds and tempeſt vpon the waters, for he wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p n="8">8. Thirdly, ſo ſoone as thou percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt, that thou haſt done ſome act of choler, repare and redreſſe the fault im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, with another contrarie act of mildnes, exerciſed promptly and ſweetly towards the ſame perſon, againſt who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me thou waſt angrie.

               <p n="1">1. ONE of the beſt exerciſes of meeknes, is that which we may practize towards our owne ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues: neuer deſpightfully fretting againſt our owne imperfections. For though reaſon command, that we should be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpleaſed &amp; ſorrie when we committ any faults, yet we muſt allway eſchew all melancholie, deſpightfull, &amp; bitter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure: wherin manie do egregiouſly offend, who ſtirred vp a litle to choler and anger, are angrie that they be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie, &amp; frett &amp; chafe, to ſee themſelues chafe; for by this manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, their hart is (as a man may ſay) ſoaked in choler; and though it ſeemes to them, that the ſecond anger, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers and bannishes away the firſt,

               <head>Of Obedience. CHAPTER 11.</head>
               <p n="1">1. CHARITIE onelie placeth vs in the hight of perfection, but obedience, chaſtitie, and pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie are three excellent inſtruments to attaine vnto it. Obedience conſecrateth our ſoule, chaſtitie dedicateth our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, pouertie applieth our goods &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to the loue, &amp; ſeruice of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God. Theſe be the three branches of the ſpirituall croſſe, which euerie man muſt beare, all three grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fourth vnderbraunche, which is humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. I will not ſay anie thing of theſe three virtues as they are vowed ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelie,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:5901:150"/> for ſo they appertaine onelie to religious perſons: nor as they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by a ſimple vowe, for though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a vowe giueth a peculiar valew and metit vnto all virtues, yet for the purpoſe which heere we pretend, it is not neceſſarie they should be vowed, ſo that they be well obſerued. When they are vowed ſolemnelie, they place a man in ſtate of perfection, but to come to perfection it ſelf, it ſufficeth that they be well obſerued: for there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the ſtate of perfection, &amp; perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſelf; all bishops &amp; religious are in the ſtate of perfection, and yet all attaine not to perfection, as we ſee but too too often. Let vs endeuour then, Philotheus, to practiſe well theſe three virtues, euerie one of vs according to our vocation: for though they promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te vs not to the ſtate of perfection, they will bring vs to perfection it ſelf, and we all haue obligation to practiſe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe virtues, though not all after one fashion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are two ſorts of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the one neceſſarie: the other voluntarie. By neceſſarie obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, thou muſt obey thy
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:5901:151"/> eccleſiaſticall ſuperiours, as the Pope, Archbishops, Bishops, Paſtours, and ſuch as are their deputies: thou muſt obey thy ciuil ſuperiours, to wit, thy Prince, and his magiſtrats, which he hath eſtabliſhed ouer thy countrie: and finally, thou muſt obey thy dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall ſuperiours, father and mother, maiſter and miſtreſſe. This obedience is called neceſſarie, becauſe no man can exempt him ſelfe, from the debt and dutie of obeying the aforeſayd ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, whome God hath placed in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, to command and gouerne, eache one according to the charge ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed vnto him ouer vs. Doe then that which they commaund, and that is neceſſarie obedience: but to doe this more perfectly, their counſailes alſo, muſt be followed &amp; their inclinations and deſires, ſo farre as charitie and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will permitte thee. Obey them, when they command ſuch things as are agreeable to thine owne will, as to eat, to recreate thy ſelf: for though it ſeeme no great virtue to obey in theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, yet would it be a great vice to diſobey in them. Obey them when they
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:5901:151"/> command things that are indifferent in them ſelues, or in thy iudgement, as to weare this, or that hab it, to goe this way, or that way, to ſing, or to be ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: and it wilbe verie commendable obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Obey them when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand hard, diſpleaſaunt, and vneaſie things: and it wilbe perfect obedience.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Obey I ſay ſweetly without replie, promptly without delaye, cheerfullie without repining, and aboue all, obey louingly, for loue of him, who for our loue made him ſelf obedient, euen to the death of the croſſe, and who (as <hi>S.</hi> Bernard ſayth) choſe rather to loſe his life, then to loſe obedience.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To learne to obey eaſilie thy ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, accuſtome thy ſelf to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend and folow the will of thy equalls, giuing place to their opinions, when they are nor vicious, or naughtie, without all ſtrife wrangling or conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, accommodate thy ſelf willingly to the deſires of thy inferiours, ſo farre as reaſon may permitte, and neuer exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe any imperious commands ouer them, ſo long as they be good and virtuous.</p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:5901:152"/>
               <p n="5">5. It is a great deceit and errour in vs, to imagin that we would obey more eaſilie, if we were religious, when we find our ſelues rebellious to ſuch as God hath placed ouer vs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We call that obedience volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, wher vnto we bind and oblige our ſelues by our owne choice, and electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and which is not impoſed vpon vs by anie other. Men chooſe not ordinarilie their prince, their bishop, their father or mother, nor manie times men their wiues, nor woemen their husbands: but they chooſe their ghoſtlie father, and ſpirituall directour. Yf then thou chooſe by vow to obey, (as we ſayd abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, that the holie mother Thereſa, beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des her obedience ſolemnelie vowed to the ſuperiour of her order, bound her ſelf by a ſimple vowe to obey father Gratian) or if without a vowe thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate thy ſelf to the obedience of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me guide and gouernour, yet allways is this obedience termed voluntarie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is grounded, vpon our free will, and depends vpon our owne ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p n="7">7. We muſt obey all our ſuperiours,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:5901:152"/> but euerie one in that, in which he hath charge ouer vs: as in that which belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to ciuil policie, and publique af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, we muſt obey our prince; our prelats in that which belongeth to ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall matters; our father, our huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, &amp; our maiſter in domeſtical buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and our ghoſtlie father or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall directour, in the peculiar guidan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of our conſcience, and ſoule.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Cauſe thy ghoſtlie father, to order diſpoſe, and impoſe, all the actions of pietie, which thou shouldeſt exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, for ſo they wilbe more excellent, clothed with a double beautie and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; the one taken from them ſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are good of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſubſtance; the other taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy obedience to thy directour, in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue wherof thou doeſt performe them.

               <head>Of the neceſsity of Chastitie. CHAPTER 12.</head>
               <p n="1">1. CHaſtitie is the lillie of virtues; it maketh me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> equall to Angels. Nothing is beautifull but by
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:5901:153"/> puritie: and the puritie of men, is chaſtitie. Chaſtitie is called honeſtie, and the profeſſion therof, honour: it is named, integritie; and the contrarie therof, corruption. In few words, chaſtitie hath this excellencie a part, to be iointly, the beautifull and louely virtue of ſoule and bodie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is neuer lawfull to receaue any vnchaſt delight from our bodies in any ſort whatſoeuer, but onely in lawfull marriage: for the ſanctitie of that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement by iuſt recompence, repaireth the loſſe we receaue in that kind of pleaſure. And yet euen in marriage, the honeſtie of the intention muſt allways be kept, that though there be ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decencie in the delight taken, yet there be always puritie and cleannes, in the intention and will that receaueth it. The chaſt hart, is like the mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearle, which receaueth no drop of brackish water, but onely the deaw that falleth from heauen: and a chaſt hart admitteth no pleaſure, but onelie in marriage, which is ordained from heauen: Excepting onelie the lawfull delight of marriage, it is not lawfull ſo
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:5901:153"/> much as in thought, to entertaine vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarilie, and deliberatlie, any vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous or carnall delight.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The firſt degree of this virtue, may be (my Philotheus) to take heed of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining any kind of pleaſure, that is prohibited, or forbidden; as all thoſe, are, which are receaued out of marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge; and thoſe likewiſe which are taken in marriage, but not according to the rule of marriage. For the ſecond degree, refraine as much as is poſſible, from all vnprofitable and ſuperfluous delights, although lawfull, and permitted. For the third degree, fix not thy affection vpon the pleaſures and delights ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and commanded in marriage it ſelf, for though it be lawfull to vſe thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, which are neceſſarie for the end, and inſtitution of matrimonie, yet for all that, we muſt neuer fix our hart thervpon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All perſons and eſtates need this virtue. They that be in widowhood, muſt haue a courageous and ſtrong chaſtitie, to auoide not onlie the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or future obiects, and occaſions of delights, but to reſiſt the imagination
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:5901:154"/> which lawfull pleaſures, receaued in marriage in former times, may breed in their remembrance, their minds ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being more ſubiect to vncleane allurements, and vnchaſt impreſſions. For which cauſe <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtin admireth the puritie of his deere frind Alypius, who had whollie deſpiſed and forgetten the pleaſures of the fleshe, though taſted by him ſometimes in his youth. And trulie we ſee, that when fruites are not yet tainted with rottenneſſe, they may be wel preſerued, ſome in ſtraw, ſome in ſand, &amp; ſome in their owne lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues: but being once tainted with a litle rotte, it is almoſt impoſſible to preſerue them long, but by confiting or conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them in honnie and ſugar. Euen ſo chaſtitie which is not yet violated, may manie wayes be garded and kept whole, and vntouched: but being once corrupted, though but a litle, can not be preſerued, but by an excellent deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which (as I haue oft repeated) is the honnie and ſugar of the mind.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Virgins haue need of a merueilous ſimple and tender chaſtitie, not ſuffring the touch of anie thing contrarie to
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:5901:154"/> their cleannes, but to bannisbe without all delay from their verie thoughts, all ſorts of curious conceipts, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, or remembrances of carnall pleaſures: which indeed, deſerue not that men should deſire them, ſince Aſſes, and ſwine be more capable of them, then men. Lett theſe pure and louely-cleane ſoules therfore, neuer doubt, but that chaſtitie is incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie better, more delightfull, &amp; more honourable, then anie pleaſure co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie thervnto. For, as great Saint Hierom ſayth, the deuill endeuoureth violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, to force virgins to deſire the triall of theſe fleshlie pleaſures, preſenting and painting them to their thoughts, infinitlie more pleaſaunt and delicious, then indeed they are: which manie ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes troubleth them much, eſteeming (as this Saint ſayth) that to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſweet, which they haue not as yet taſted. For as the litle Butterflie, ſeeing the flame of a candle, hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth curiouſlie about it, to proue whether it be as ſweete, as it is faire; and forced with this fantaſie, ceaſeth not, till she burne her ſelfe to death</p>

Neuer ſuffer any man (ô Philothee) to touch thee vnciuilly, eyther for myrthe, or for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: for though peraduenture chaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie may be preſerued in thoſe actions, that are more of lightnes then of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice: yet the puritie and flower of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, receaueth ſome detriment &amp; loſſe by them. But to ſuffer thy ſelf to be touched dishoneſtly by any, is the vtter ruine and ouerthrow of chaſtitie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chaſtitie dependeth of the ſoule as of her originall roote, and reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth the bodie, as the matter about which she worketh. This is the cauſe that she may leeſe her ſelf by all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour ſences of the bodie, and by the temptations and deſires of the ſoule. It is laſciuiouſneſſe to behold, to heare, to ſpeak, to ſmell, or touch any disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt thing, when the ſoule obſerueth it,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:5901:155"/> dallieth in it, and taketh delight and pleaſure therin. Saint Paul in one word ſayth: <hi>Let not fornication be ſo much as once named amongſt you.</hi> The Bees not only refuſe to touch any carrion, but hate extremly, and therfore flie haſtely, from all vnſauourie ſmells proceeding from it. The ſacred ſpouſe in the Canticles is ſayd, to haue her hands full of myrre that it droppeth downe from her fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and myrre preſerueth from corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; her lippes are coloured with a blushing vermillion, betokening mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie and shamefaſtnes in words; Her eyes are of Doues, for their puritie; she weareth golden earings, as neuer daring to heare of any vncleanneſſe; her noſe is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to the cedars of Libanus, that are incorruptible: ſuch ought to be the ſoule of Chriſts ſeruant, chaſt, honeſt, cleane in hands, lippes, eyes, eares, and all her bodie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To this purpoſe will I tell thee what the ancient father Iohn Caſſian reporteth, as from the mouth of Sainct Baſil the great: who ſpeaking of him ſelfe, ſayde: <hi>I know not what belongeth to wemen, yet am I not a Virgin.</hi> For
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:5901:156"/> truly chaſtitie may be loſt as manie wayes, as there be kindes of laſciuiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and fleshlie delights: which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they are great or litle, ſo dee they weaken, wound, or kill it out right. There are certaine particular frindships, and vndiſcreet, foolish, ſenſuall paſſions, which to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie, do not violate and corrupt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, but yet do greatlie weaken it, and ſtaine the beautifull white of this pure virtue. There are other familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and paſſionate frindships, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie indiſcreet, but vitious; not onelie fond, but dishoneſt with all; not onely ſenſuall, but carnal: and by theſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie is at leaſt ſorelie hurt, and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: I ſay at the leaſt wounded, becauſe it dieth and perisheth altogether, when theſe dalliances and wanton actions, do cauſe in the flesh the vttermoſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of voluptuous delight: for then it is loſt more vildly, wickedlie, and deteſtablie, then when it is corrupted by fornication, by adulterie, by inceſt; ſince theſe latter kindes of dishoneſtie, are onlie ſinnes; but the former (as Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuallia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſayth in his booke of chaſtitie, or
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:5901:156"/> shamfaſtneſſe) are certaine monſters of iniquitie. Now neither Caſſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor I my ſelf thihck, that <hi>S.</hi> Baſils words are to be vnderſtood of any ſuch filthie diſorder, when he ſayd of him ſelf, that he was no virgin: but he ſayd ſo onelie for vnchaſt &amp; voluptuous thoughts, which though they defiled not his bodie, yet did they contaminat his ſoule, of the puritie and chaſtnes wherof, all generous and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirits are exceeding iealous.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Haunt not the companie of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt perſons, principallie, if withall they be shameleſſe, and impudent, as for the moſt part they be. For as the hee Goates, licking the ſweete Almond trees with their tongues, do make them degenerate into bitter Almonds: ſo theſe wanton ſoules, infected with the ſtinche of fleshlie luſts, do ſcarce ſpeak to anie of either ſex, but they make them in ſome ſort, fall from the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their chaſtitie: they beare poiſon in theire eyes, and in theire breath like Baſiliskes.

The Alcyons make their neſts no bigger then the palme of a ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and leaue but one litle hole in them, on the vpper ſide: then do they place them vpon the edge of the ſea-shore, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me it ſo firme and ſound in all parts, that when the waues doe chance to hoiſe them ſelues vp, yet the water can neuer get in, but they remaine floting aboue the waues; hauing allways as it were, the vpper hand of the ſea, euen in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the ſea.

THE painter Parrhaſius, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in his pictures, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Athens by a moſt wittie inuention, painting out their diuerſe and variable humours, cholerick, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, vnconſtant, vncourteous, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:5901:159"/> high-minded, proude, humble, and cowardly: and all this together. But I (my deare Philotheus, would doe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re then all this, for I would put into thy hart riches and pouertie both at once, a great care, and a great contempt, of temporall affaires.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take much more care to make thy temporall goods profitable, and gainfull, then worldly men doe. Tell me, the gardiners of great princes, are they not more curious, and diligent to deck and trimme vp the gardens they haue commended to them in charge, then yf they were their owne in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie? And what is the reaſon therof? becauſe without dout they conſider thoſe gardens, as Kinges and Princes gardens, vnto whome they deſire to make themſelues acceptable, by their good ſeruice. My Philotheus, the wealth and poſſeſſions which we haue, are none of ours, God hath committed them vnto our charge to cultiuate them, and his will is, that we make them profitable and gainfull: and therfore we doe him good ſeruice when we take care of them. But this
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:5901:160"/> care muſt be in vs greater, &amp; conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then worldlings haue of their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. For their labours are for the loue of them ſelues, and ours muſt be for the loue of God. Now as ſelf-loue is violent, trouble ſome, and haſtie; ſo the care that we take to ſatisfie this ſelf-loue, is full of vexation, of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishe, and diſquiet; And as the loue of God is ſweet, peaceable, and quiet: ſo the care which proceedeth from it, although it be euen about worldly goods, is both amiable, ſweet, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. Let vs then haue this gracious care of preſeruing, yea and of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing our temporall commodities, whenſoeuer any iuſt occaſion shall preſent it ſelfe, and ſo farre foorth, as our eſtate and condition requireth: for God will that we doe ſo, for the loue of him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But take heed that ſelf loue decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue thee not, for ſome-time it counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faiteth ſo craftilie the loue of God, that thou wouldſt verilie thinck it were the ſame. Now that it deceaue thee not; and that this care of thy tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral goods, turne not into ſecret auarice,

               <p n="4">4. Allwayes then aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>don ſome part of thy goods, beſtowing it vpon the poore with a willing hart, for to giue away that which one hath, is to impouerish him ſelf willing lie, and the more one giueth, the more poore he becometh.

O how holy &amp; rich is that pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which cometh by almes-deeds?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Loue poore folk, &amp; pouertie, for ſo ſhalt thou become poore in deed, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe as the holy ſcripture teaceth, <hi>we are made like the things which we loue.</hi> Loue makes louers felowes, &amp; equalls; <hi>who is weak</hi> (ſayth <hi>S.</hi> Paul) <hi>with whome I am not weake?</hi> he might haue ſaid likewiſe: who

Yf then thou loue the poore fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy hart, thou shalt be trulie partaker of their pouertie, &amp; become as poore, as they. But yf thou loue the poore, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe this thy loue, by going ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them: be glad to ſee them in thine owne houſe, and viſit them in theirs; keep them companie willingly, reioyce that they approache nighthee in the church, in the ſtreet, and els where. Be poore in talking, ſpeaking, and conuerſing, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſlie amonge them: but be riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed, giuing them liberallie of thy goods, as hauing more abundance.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Wilt thou goe one ſteppe farther, my Philotheus, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent not thy ſelf to be poore, but procure to be poorer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the poore the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. And how may that be? The ſeruant is inferiour to his maiſter: be thou then a ſeruant of the poore: goe and attend on them in their beds, when they are ſick, I ſay attend on them, and ſerue them with thine owne hands: be their cooke thy ſelf, and at thine owne expences, be their landreſſe, and blea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of their linnen. O Philotheus, this

I cannot ſufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the ardent affection, with which this councell was put in practize by <hi>S.</hi> Lewes, one of the greateſt kings vnder the ſonne, &amp; I meane, one oft the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in all kind of greatnes &amp; excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. He waited oft times at the table of the poore, whome he nourished, &amp; cauſed three poore men almoſt euerie day, to dine at his owne table, &amp; eat him ſelf often the reliques of their potage, with ſuch a loue as the like hath not beene ſeene. When he viſited the hoſpitalls of ſick folk; (which he did verie often) he ſerued them ordinarilie, which had the moſt horrible and loathſome diſeaſes, as lazers, cankers, and ſuch like: and performed all this ſeruice vnto them bare-headed, and kneeling on the ground, conſidering and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting in their perſons, the Saueour of the world: and cherrishing them with as tender a loue, as any ſweete mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could doe her one child. Saint Eliſabeth daughter to the king of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, often times put her ſelf amongſt the poore, and for her recreation,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:5901:162"/> ſometimes would apparell her ſelf like a poore woman amongſt her ladies, ſaying vnto them, yf I were poore, thus would I attire my ſelf. O good God (Philotheus) how poore were this Prince and princeſſe, amidſt their royall riches, and how riche were they, in this their admirable pouertie! Bleſſed be they that be poore in this ſort, for vnto them belongeth the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. <hi>I was hungry, and you gaue me to eate: I was naked and you clothed me; poſſeſſe you the kingdom prepared for you, from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world:</hi> will the king of the poore, and of kings, ſay at his great doomes day.</p>

Another time in a long iourney, we light vpon ſome cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to lodge in, where all things are lacking; wher there is nether table, nor chaire, nor bed, nor chamber, nor anie to ſerue vs. To be brief, it is a verie or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie thinge, to ſtand oft times in need of ſome neceſſarie commoditie, be we otherwiſe neuer ſo rich; well, this is to be poore in effect, and in verie deed, when we lack theſe things. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotheus, reioice in ſuch occaſions, and accept them with all thy hart, and ſuffer them cheerfully, for Gods loue.</p>

When ſome inconuenience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falles that empouerisheth thee, ether of a great deale or of a litle, as tempeſt, fire, inundations, dearth, theeues, proceſſe, perſecution, or the like, ô then Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus is the time indeed, to practize po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie of ſpirit, receauing with mildnes this loſſe &amp; diminishing of our wealth, and accommodating our ſelues, patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly and conſtantly, to this vnexpected empouerishement. Eſau preſented him ſelfe to his father, with his hands all
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:5901:163"/> hairie, and ſo did Iacob likewiſe: but becauſe the haire that couered Iacobs hands, ſtuck not to his owne skin, but to his gloues, one might haue taken away the haire from him without hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him: but becauſe the haire of Eſaus hands, grew vpon his owne skinne, and not vpon his gloues, being hairie by nature, he that would haue endeuoured to pull of his haire, should haue put him to paine and torment, and he would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ſtriued and ſweat to defend him ſelf from fleaing. When our riches cleaue to our verie ſoule, if a tempeſt, if thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, if a catch pole do but ſnatch anie peece from vs, what complaints, what ſtirres, what impatience preſently shew we? But when our riches cleaue but onely to the care that God would haue vs take, and do not ſtick to our hart, if they fleece vs, and deſpoile vs of them, we do not fall beſide our ſelues ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor looſe the quiet and tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of mind. This is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt beaſts, and men as touching their clothes: for beaſts clothes, ſtick to their fleshe, and mens apparel, are only caſt about them, ſo that they may be

               <p n="1">1. LOVE hath the firſt and chiefe place among all the paſſions of the ſoule: it is the king of all the motions of the hart, it changeth all the other into it ſelf, and maketh vs alltoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch, as is the thing which we loue: take heed then, O Philotheus, that thou loue no bad thing, for then thou thy ſelf wilt become altogether bad. Now of all loue, frindship is the moſt da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe other loue may be built vpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, hardly can one haue frind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with another, without participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his qualities and conditions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All loue is not amitie or frindship for one may loue, and not be beloued, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is there loue, and not frindship: becauſe frindshippe, is a mutuall loue, and yf the loue be not mutuall, it is nor, frindshippe. Neither is it enough that it be mutuall, but the parties that loue one another, muſt know and ackno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wledge the affection that is betweene them: for yf they know it not, they
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:5901:166"/> haue loue one to the other, but not frindshippe. There muſt be alſo ſome ſort of communication betwene them, for that is the ground of amitie: and according to the diuerſitie of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, frindshippe alſo is diuerſe: &amp; communications are diuerſe, according to the diuerſitie of goods which they do mutually co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate: yf they be falſe, vaine, and forged goods, then is the frindshippe falſe and forged: yf they be good indeed, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the frindshippe true; and the more excellent the goods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated be, the more excellent is the frindshippe. The honnie is beſt, that is gathered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bloſſoms of the ſweeteſt and excellenteſt floures: and as there is honie in Heraclea a Prouince of Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tus, which is poiſonous, and maketh them ſenceleſſe that taſt of it, becauſe it is gathered from the venemous hearbe Aconitum; which groweth in great abundance in that countrie: euen ſo frindſhipp grounded vpon the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of falſe and vitious things, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together falſe and wicked frindshippe.</p>

I call friuolous virtues, certaine abilities &amp; vaine qualities, which feeble
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:5901:167"/> and ignorant witts call virtues, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Harken to the greater part of maidens, women, &amp; young folk, they will not faile to terme ſuch a gentleman wondrons virtuous, and endewed with great perfections, becauſe he danceth well, he playeth well at all games, he goeth decently apparelled, he ſingeth wel, he diſcourſeth well, he is of a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely behaueour.

VVHEN theſe foolish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities paſſe among per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of diuerſe ſex, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pretence of mariage, they be called rightly loue-toyes: for being but certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne abortiue, or vntimely images, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shadowes of amitie, they deſerue not the name of true loue or frindship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe, for their inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable vanitie &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection. And yet by them are the harts of men &amp; women engaged, chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and entangled the one with the other in vaine, vpon foolish affections, founded vpon theſe friuolous commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, &amp; fond delights, of which but euen now I ſpake. And although theſe foolish loues do ordinarilie melt, and turne into carnall actions, and filthie laſciuiouſneſſe: yet that is not the firſt deſigne &amp; intention of the perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt whome they paſſe, for then they would no more be loue-toyes, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and deteſtable leacherie. Some times manie yeares paſſe, ere any ſuch
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:5901:168"/> groſſe wickedneſſe happen betweene them, that are infected with this follie: and no action wilbe committed direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie contrarie to bodilie chaſtitie: the parties onelie contenting them ſelues to ſteepe their harts, (as it were) in wishes, deſires, ſighes, wooing ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and ſuch like vanities, and all this for ſondrie motiues and pretenſions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some haue no other deſigne then onlie to ſatisfie theire harts in giuing and taking loue, folowing their amou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deſires: and theſe take not much conſideration in choice of their loues, but onlie folow the caſt of their owne inclination: ſo that at the firſt encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of anie obiect pleaſing their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, neuer examining the inward conditions, or qualities, of the partie, they will out of hand begin this friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous communication of wanton loue, and thruſt them ſelues ſo farre into thoſe miſerable ſnares, from which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward they shall haue much a doe to deliuer them ſelues. Others ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to walke that trade of vanitie, eſteeming it no ſmall glorie, to take &amp; linck harts together by loue: and theſe
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:5901:168"/> perſons, making election of their loue for glories ſake, ſet vp their ſnares, and ſpread their ſayles, in great, eminent, rare, and illuſtrious places. Others are caried away both by theire amourous inclination, and vaine glorie iointlie: for though theire hart is all together inclined to loue, yet will they not talke of it, without ſome adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage of glorie. Theſe amities are all naught, foolish, &amp; vaine: naught, becauſe they end and die at length in the ſinne of the flesh, and ſteale away the noble paſſion of loue, and conſequentlie, the hart from God, from the maried wife, &amp; from the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, to whome it was due; foolishe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue neither reaſon, nor foundation: vaine, becauſe they yeld no profit, nor honour, nor contentment: nay contrarilie, they looſe time, ſtaine honour, and giue no other pleaſure, but onely a vaine deſire to hope for they know not what, and prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not wherfore; for it ſeemeth ſtill to theſe baſe &amp; feeble ſpirits, that there is I wot not what, to be deſired in the teſtimonies &amp; ſignes which are shewed them of mutuall loue: but they cannot
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:5901:169"/> tell what it is: ſo that their deſire is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, &amp; hath no bound, goinge ſtill on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and vexinge their harts with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall diſtaſts, iealouſies, ſuſpicions, and diſquietnes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>S.</hi> Gregory Nazianzen, writinge againſt vaine wemen, &amp; loue-wantons, ſayth merueilous well of this matter; a litle parcell of the much, that he direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſpeaketh againſt wemen (but may as directly be applied againſt men) is this that foloweth: <hi>Thy naturall beautie is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for thy husband: but if it be for many men, like to a nett ſpread out for a flock of foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish birds, what will become of it? he will be pleaſing to thee, that hath pleaſed him ſelf in thy beauty: thou wilt render him glaunce, for glaunce, one wanton locke for another: ſoone after will folow prettie ſimles, and often ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, languishing loue-tearmes shot forth at randome, for an entrance, or firſt begining: but ſoone after wilt thou paſſe to plaine &amp; mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festidle talke. Take heed ô my prating tongue, to tell what vſually folowes: yet will I ſay this one truth; nothinge of all thoſe things which young men and maidens, ſay, and do together in theſe foolish paſſetimes, is exempted from great and ſtinginge motions of the ſlesh; all
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:5901:169"/> the tricks of wanton loue, are lincked one with another and do folow one another, euen as one peece of iron drawne by the load-ſtone, dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth diuers other peeces likewiſe after it.</hi> O how well ſaith this great and godlie bishope, what doeſt thou intend to doe? to make loue? but no bodie maketh loue voluntarilie, that doth not recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue it neceſſarilie. He that catcheth in this ſport, is likewiſe caught him ſelf. The hearbe Aproxis receaueth fire ſo ſoone as it commeth neer it: our harts do the like; ſo ſoone as they ſee a hart inflamed with loue for them, they are preſentlie inflamed with loue for it. Well (will another ſay) I will take but a litle of this flame of loue. Alas thou deceaueſt thy ſelf, this loue-fire is more actiue then thou imagineſt, when thou makeſt account to haue receaued but one ſparckle therof into thy hart, thou wilt be amazed to ſee that in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it will haue ſeaſed vpon thy whole hart, and burnt to ashes all thy reſolutions, and turnd thy reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into ſmoke. The wiſeman crieth out: <hi>who will haue compaſsion vpon an enchanter, ſtung by a ſerpeut?</hi>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:5901:170"/> I alſo crie after him: O fooles and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celeſſe harts, thinck you to charme lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, and tame it as you liſt your ſelues? you would play and dallie with it, but it will bite and ſting you to the hart: &amp; what thinck you then will beſpoken of you? euerie one will deſeruedly mock and ſcoffe at you, that would needs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertake to enchaunt loue, that vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe aſſurance, would put into your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſo dangerous a ſnake, which hath enuenomed your ſoule, and poiſoned your honour and eſtimation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. O good God! how miſerable a blindnes is it, to trifle away in this ſort, vpon ſo friuolous an aduantage, the principall iewell of our ſoule? Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus, God careth not for man, but in regard of his ſoule: nor for the ſoule, but in regard of the will: nor for the will, but in regard of the excellent acts of loue. Alas how much want we of that ſtore of loue which we need? the defect of our loue to God-ward is infinite, and yet in the meane time, wretches that we be, we lauish it out and miſpend it riotouſly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vaine &amp; friuolous things, as if we had enough, and too much to
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:5901:170"/> ſpare. But conſider that our great God, who hath reſerued to him ſelf the loue of the ſoule, onlie for an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our creation, conſeruation, &amp; redemption: will exact a verie ſtraight account, for all theſe foolishe expences of ſo pretious riches: if he make ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gourous an examination of idle words, what will he do of idle, impertinent, foolish, and pernicious loues?</p>

The Walnutte tree endamageth the vines and fields where it is planted: for being ſo great a tronk, it draweth all the fat &amp; ſappe of the ground where it gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, and maketh it afterward vnable to nourish other pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: the leaues therof are ſo ſtuffed together, that they make too large and thick a shadow; and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth trauailers vnto it, who to beat downe the nuttes, ſpoile &amp; tread downe all round about it. Theſe wanton loues doe the verie ſame harme to the ſoule: for they do whollie poſſeſſe the ſoule, &amp; ſo vehemently draw all the other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vnto it, that she is not able to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy her powers in any other good work their entertainments, communicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, parlies, and amourous toyes, are ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,

To be brieffe, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe wanton loues doe not onely thruſt out of dores the heauenly loue of God, but with all bannish the feare and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of his maieſtie, and weaken the ſpirit, impaire their reputation: they are in a word the may game and paſtime of courtes, but the miſchief, deſtruction, and peſtilence of harts.</p>

               <p n="1">1. BVT now marke an excellent &amp; neceſſarie aduerticement, my Philotheus; The honny of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclea (of which we ſpake before) which is ſo venimous, is like the other which is wholſome, ſo that there is daunger to take the one for the other, or to mingle them both together; for the goodnes of the one, would not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the harme which might come by the other. He muſt be vpon his garde, that will not be deceaued in theſe frind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, principallie when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted betwixt perſons of diuers ſex,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:5901:174"/> vnder what pretence ſoeuer: for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel oftentimes chaungeth one frind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship into the other. They beginne by virtuous loue, but yf they be not verie warie, fond and idle loue will firſt min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle it ſelf, then ſenſuall loue, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward carnall and fleshly loue. Nay the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is daunger in ſpirituall loue, yf one be not verie diſcreet: though in this it be more difficultie for the diuel to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen vs in the change, becauſe the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and milk-white cleannes of this loue diſcouereth verie eaſilie the filth that ſatan offereth to mingle with it: and therfore when he enterprizeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue vs in this, he doeth it more craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie, and maketh impure affections to ſlide into vs, almoſt without our notice or feeling.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thou mayſt diſcerne worldly frind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, from holie and virtuous amitie, as the Heraclaean honnie, is knowne from the wholſome: the honnie of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclaea is ſweeter to taſt, then the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary honnie is, becauſe of the luſcious iuice of the Aconite, for whence it is gathered: and ſo worldlie amitie flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth with a ſtreame of honnie words,

The honnie of Heraclea ſwallowed downe, cauſeth a dizzineſſe in the heade: &amp; fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe frindship breedeth a giddines in the mind, making men to ſtagger in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, to ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble in deuotion, tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sporting true and holie affection, to daintie lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing lookes, ſenſuall allurements, diſordered ſighes, pettie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints that they are not beloued, to alluring ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of loue termes, pourſuite of kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp; other too familiar and vnciuil fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, which are aſſured and vndoubted ſignes of a neer ouerthrow of honeſtie. But as for holie frindship, it hath no eyes but ſimple, chaſt, &amp; shamefaſt: no entertaniments or embracements, but ſuch as be pure &amp; francklie offered in ſight of all men; no ſighes, but for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; no fauours, but ſpirituall; no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,

The honnie of Heraclea troubleth the ſight, and this worldlie frindship blindeth the iudgement, ſo that they which be infected therwith, thinck they doe well, when they doe ill, and eſteeme their excuſes and pretexts to be true and irreprocheable reaſons; they feare the light, and loue darknes. But holie frindship hath a cleere eye ſight, and neuer hideth her ſelf, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth willinglie before honeſt perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. In fine the honnie of Heraclea, leaueth a bitter relish in the mouth: and ſo falſe and wanton frindships, turne to carnall wordes, &amp; fleshlie requeſts, and, if they receaue the deniall, into iniuries, cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, ſlaunders, ſadnes, confuſions, iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, which oft times prouoke wildnes &amp; madnes of mind. But chaſt &amp; true frind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, is allways alike honeſt, mannerlie, amiable, and neuer changeth, but into a perfecter and purer vnion of ſpirits, and is a liuelie image of the bleſſed frind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship vſed in heauen.</p>

               <head>Aduices and remedies againſt naughty frindships. CHAP. 21.</head>
               <p n="1">1. BVT what remedie againſt this wicked ſeminarie of foolish loues, and wanton impurities? As ſoone as euer thou feeleſt thy ſelf ſurprized with this infection, turne thy ſelf away immediatly, and with an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute deteſtation of this vanitie, runne vnto the ſacred Croſſe of our Sauiour, and take his crowne of thornes to put about thy hart, to the end theſe litle foxes approach no nigher.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take heed of coming vnto any kind of compoſition with this falſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie; ſay not: I will giue him the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but will do nothing that he shall will me; I will lend mine eares vnto him, but denie him my hart. O no Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotheus,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:5901:177"/> for Gods loue be rigorous and ſtiffe in theſe occaſions. The hart and the eare maintaine one another: and as it is impoſſible to ſtoppe a ſtrong ſtrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, that taketh his deſcent from a ſteep mountaine: ſo it is hard to hinder, that the loue which entreth into the eare, make not likewiſe his entrie into the hart. Alcmaeon ſayd, that Goats do breath by the eares, and not by the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthrills: true it is that Ariſtotle denieth it, and for my part I know nothing therof: yet this I am aſſured, that our hart breatheth by the eare; and that as it aſpireth, and ſendeth foorth his thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghts by the mouthe, ſo it reſpireth and taketh breath by the eare, by which it receaueth other mens thoughts. Let vs then keep our eares diligently from the ayre of foolish words, leaſt it infect our hart. Harken not then to any kind of wanton motion or prepoſition, vnder what pretext ſo euer it be made, onely in this caſe it makes no matter, to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteous and vnmannerlie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Remember that thou haſt vowed thy hart to God, and ſacrifized all thy loue to him, it should then be ſacriledge
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:5901:177"/> to take one dram therof fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: rather offer it againe &amp; againe vnto him, by a thouſand hartie reſolutions &amp; proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and keeping thy ſelf cloſe within the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as Deer within theire thickets, call vpon God; he will help thee, his loue will take thine into his protection, that thy loue may liue for him only.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But yf thou be alreadie enſnared in the netts of theſe foolish loues: O God what difficultie will it be to shift thy ſelf out? Preſent thy ſelf before the diuine maieſtie, acknowledge in his preſence, the greatnes of thy miſerie, frailtie, and vanitie. Then with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt force that thy hart is able to make, deteſt theſe loues, which thou haſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunn, abiure the vaine profeſſion, which thou haſt made of them; renounce all the promiſes made or receaued: and with a firme and reſolute will, determine in thy hart, and reſolue thy ſelf, neuer any more, to enter into theſe fond di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſportes, and toyish entertainments of wanton loue.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Yf thou couldſt withdraw thy ſelf from the obiect, it were an excellent remedie. For as they that haue been
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:5901:178"/> bitten by ſerpents, cannot eaſilie be cured in the preſence of them which haue beene other time hurt with the ſame biting: ſo the perſon which is bitt with loue, shall haue much a doe to be healed of this paſſion, ſo long as he is nigh the other, which is hurt with the ſame ſting. Chaunge of place is a ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne remedie to appeaſe and allay, the tormenting heats of griefe and loue. The boy, of whome <hi>S.</hi> Ambroſe, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in his ſecond booke of penance, hauing made a long voyage, returned altogether freed and deliuered from his foolish loues, in which he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore entangled, and became ſo chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that his fond ſweete hart meeting him, and ſaying, knoweſt thou not me? I am the ſame that I was. I marrie anſwered he, but I am not the ſame that I was: his abſence had brought him, to this fortunate mutation. And Saint Auguſtin witneſſeth, that to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate the grief which he ſuffered for the death of his frind, he withdrew him ſelf from Tagaſta, where his frind died, and came to Carthage.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But he that cannot withdraw him
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:5901:178"/> ſelf, what muſt he doe? he muſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely cutt off all particular conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all ſecret familiaritie, all amiable glaunces of the eyes, all dalliyng ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and generally all ſort of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, and baytes, or inticements which may nourish this ſulphurous &amp; ſmokie fire. Or at leaſt, yf he be forced to ſpeak and talk with the partie, let him in a round, rough, and reſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, declare the eternall and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocable diuorcement, that is for euer ſworne between them: I crie as loud as I can to euerie one that is fallen into this miſerable thraldome of wanton loue, that he cutt, breake, and rent them aſunder, and not ſtand dreaming to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rippe, or vnſewe theſe foolish amities: they muſt cutt, and not ſtande to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſe the knotts, break them I ſay, or cutt them, becauſe cordes, and ſtrings are nothing worth. One muſt not be ſparing, or courteous, towards a loue, which is ſo contrarie to the loue of God.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But when I haue broken the chaine of this infamous bondage, there will yet remaine vnto me ſome ſcarres
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:5901:179"/> ſome marks, and prints of the ſlauish chaynes and shackles wherwith I was bound; they will ſtick ſtill emprinted in my feet, that is in my affections. No my Philotheus, care not, they will not remaine long yf thou conceaue as great a deteſtation of thy ſinne, as it deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth: for ſo thou shalt neuer be shaken with any motion, but onely this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an extreame horrour of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous loue, and of all things that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende of it: and thou shalt remaine free from all other affection to the obiect which thou hadſt abandoned, ſauing only the affection of charitie, purely for Gods cauſe. But yf for the imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thy repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, there shall yet remaine in thy ſoule any naughtie inclinations: procure for thy ſoule a ſolitarie ermita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, as before I haue taught thee, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire thy ſelf thether, the ofteneſt that thou canſt; and by a thouſand iterated reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of ſpirit, renounce all thy bad inclinations, reiect them with all thy forces; read holie bookes more then thou waſt woont, goe to confeſſion oftener, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferre humblie and plainlie all thy

And doubt not, but God will ſett thee free from all paſſions, ſo that thou perſeuer faithfully in thy good exerciſes.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Ah (wilt thou ſay vnto me) but will it not be ingratitude, to break ſo violently an old frindship? O bleſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude which maketh vs acceptable vnto God! Nay in the name of God, Philothee, this wilbe no ingratitude, but an infinite benefit, which thou shalt doe to the partie that loues thee: for in breaking thine owne bonds, thou bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſt a ſunder alſo theirs, in as much they were common to you both: and though at that hower, the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſeeth not the happines, yet he will acknowledge it ſoone after, and iointlie with thee, will ſing for thankfulnes to almightie God: <hi>O Lord thou haſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken my bonds, I will ſacrifize to thee a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifize of praiſe, and wil call vpon thy holy name.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. I HAVE yet a note of imporance to giue thee touching this ſelf ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me matter. Frindship requireth great communication betweene frinds, otherwiſe it will nether grow, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinew. It happeneth oftentimes that iointlie with this communication of frindship, other communications doe paſſe vnſeene, and vnfelt from one hart to another, by a mutuall infuſion and enterchange of affections, inclinations and impreſſions. This happeneth eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie, when we greatlie eſteeme of the partie whome we loue: for then we open our hart in ſuch ſort to his amitie, that withall, theſe inclinations and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, enter verie eaſilie altogether, be they good, or bad. Verelie the Bees that ſtore vp honnie in Heraclea, doe ſearch nothing els but honnie, and yet togeather with the honnie, they ſuck vp vnawares, the venemous qualitie of
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:5901:180"/> the Aconite, vpon which they make their harueſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. O my Philothee, in this caſe, practize the wordes which the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueour of our ſoules was woont to ſay, as the auncient doctours haue taught vs: be good bankers, or good exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of monie: that is to ſay, receaue not falſe mony with the good, nor baſe gold with fyne: ſeparate the good from the bad, and the vile from that which is precious. For there is no man almoſt, but hath ſome imperfection: and what reaſon is there, to receaue the ſtaines and imperfections of a frind, togeather with his frindship? We muſt loue him indeed, notwithſtanding his imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but we muſt nether loue, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his imperfection, for frindship re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of good, &amp; not of ill: wherfore as they that take grauel out of the riuer Tajo in ſpaine, ſeparate the golden graines which they find, to carie with them, and leaue the ſand vpon the shoare: ſo in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, euen of good and virtuous frind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, we muſt ſeparate the gold of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, from the ſand of imperfections,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:5901:181"/> and receaue thoſe, and reiect theſe, that they enter in no caſe into our ſoule.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>S.</hi> Gregory Nazianzen recounteth, that manie louing and admiring <hi>S.</hi> Baſil the great, ſuffered them ſelues ſo farre to be caried away with deſire of imitating him, that they ſought to folow euen his outward imperfections, as in his ſlowe manner of ſpeaking, with an abſtract and penſiue ſpirit, in the fashion of his beard, in his ſtraunge manner of gate. And we ſee likewiſe, husbands, wiues, children, and frinds, who hauing great eſtimation of their frinds, parents, husbands, and wiues, do learne either by condeſcendence, or by imitation, a thouſand ſuch like humours, only by the frequent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication which they haue one with another. Yet ought not this to be done, for euerie one hath naughtie inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s enow of his owne, without ſurcharging himſelf with other mens faultes: and frindship doth not onely, not require any ſuch matter, but contrariwiſe, it bindeth vs to help one another mutuallie from theſe imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. We muſt indeed meekly ſuffer our frinds in their imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but we
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:5901:181"/> muſt not throw them into them, and much leſſe pull them into our ſelues. I ſpeak only of imperfections: for as for ſinnes, we muſt neither beare them our ſelues, nor ſuffer them in our frinds.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is either a naughtie, or a feeble frindship, to ſee our frind readie to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, and not ſuccour him: to ſee him readie to die of an impoſtume, &amp; not to dare to launce it with the razor, of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, ſo to ſaue his life: true &amp; liuely amitie, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not liue amongſt ſinne. They ſay the Salamandra, putteth out the fier in which she lieth: and ſo doth ſinne deſtroy that frindship, wherin it lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth: yf it be a ſinne that quicklie paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, frindship will preſently bannish it by correction: but yf it be a ſinne that abideth and ſoiourneth in our frinds hart, then frindship ſoone perisheth, for it cannot ſubſiſt but vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> true virtue: and how much leſſe then ought we to ſinne our ſelues, for frindships ſake.

               <p>an almond-tree from its kernell, will bring foorth all her actions, which are her fruicts, engraued and ſuperſcribed with that ſame word of ſaluation. And as this ſweet Ieſus will liue in thy hart, ſo will he liue in all thy geſture, and behaue our, and will appeere in thine eyes, in thy mouth, in thy hands, and euen in thy haire, and thou wilt be then able to ſay with Saint Paule: <hi>I liue now, not I; but Chriſt liueth in me.</hi> To be brief, he that hath gained the hart of a man, hath gained the man him ſelf wholly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the ſame hart, by which we would begin, requireth to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, how it should behaue and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne it ſelf in exteriour occaſions: to the end men may not onely ſee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, but wiſdome alſo, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in it: for this cauſe I will lay downe vnto thee, a few brief ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yf thou art able to endure fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, accuſtom thy ſelf to faſt ſome times, beſide the faſt which holie Churche enioineth; for ſo beſides the ordinarie effects of faſting, which are
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:5901:182"/> to eleuate the ſpirit, to tame the flesh, to practize virtue, to winne greater recompence in heauen; it is a ſoueraigne meanes, to chaine vp the deuouring monſter of gluttonnie: and to bridle the ſenſuall appetite, and to keepe the bodie ſubiect and plia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the lawe of the ſpirit. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though one faſt not with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie rigour; yet the enemie fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs, when he perceaueth we can find in our hart to faſt ſomething. Wedneſdays, frydays, and ſaturdays, are the dayes, in which the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians did exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in abſtinence: take ſome of them therfore to faſt in, as much as thy deuotion, and thy ghoſtlie councellours diſcretion shall councell thee.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I would willinglie ſay, as holie <hi>S.</hi> Hierom ſayd to the deuout ladie Laeta: <hi>Long and immoderate faſtings do much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpleaſe me, eſpecially in thoſe that are yet ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in yeares.</hi> I haue learned by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the litle Aſſe being wearie in his iourney, ſeeketh to go out of the way: I meane, that young folk
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:5901:183"/> being brought low through exceſſe of faſting, doe fall willinglie to reſt and delicateneſſe. The Deer runne ill in two ſeaſons, when they are charged with ouermuch fat, and when they become ouer-leane. We are likewiſe moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to tentations, when our bodie is to much pampered with daintie fare: and when it is ouer weakened: for the one exceſſe, maketh it inſolent with eaſe, and the other maketh it deſperate with affliction; And as we can ſcantlie beare it, when it is vnweldie through fatnes: ſo can it not beare vs, when it is enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by leanneſſe. The back of this moderation in faſting, in diſciplininge in hairclothes, and other auſterities, make the beſt yeares of manie to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable in the chiefe works of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; (as it did in <hi>S.</hi> Bernard him ſelf, who repented that he had vſed ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much auſteritie) the more vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie they afflicted their bodies in their beginning, the more were they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained in the end to ſpare and fauour them. Had they not done better, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue mortified their bodie indifferentlie, and proportionablie to the offices and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:5901:183"/> labours, whervnto their ſtate obliged them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Faſting and labour both doe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and ſubdue the fleshe. But if the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour which thou art to doe, be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, or verie profitable to the glorie of God, I had rather thou wouldſt ſuffer the toile of labour, then of faſting. This is at leaſt the intention of holie church; which for labours that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the ſeruice of God and our neighbour, diſchargeth ſuch as are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in them, from the faſtes otherwiſe inioyned. It is painfull indeed to faſt, but bodilie labour ſuffereth this paine in ſeruing the ſick, in viſiting priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, hearing confeſſions, aſſiſting the deſolate, preaching, praying, &amp; in ſuch like exerciſes: this painfull toile is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the other; for beſides that it weakeneth the bodie as much as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, it hath manie more fruicts, and much more deſirable. And therfore ſpeaking generallie, it is better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue more bodilie forces then are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely needfull, then to weaken them more then one should: for we may all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abate them and pull them downe
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:5901:184"/> when we will: but we cannot repare them allways when we would.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Mee thinks we should greatly reuerence the wordes which our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saueour ſayth vnto his diſciples: <hi>Eate that which shalbe ſett before you.</hi> It is (as I imagin) a greater virtue to eat without choice, that which is preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto thee, be it for thy taſt or no, then to chooſe allway the worſt. For allthough this later kind of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, doe ſeeme more auſtere: the other notwithſtanding hath grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſignation; for therby one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth, not onely his owne taſt, but his owne election withall; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it a ſmall mortification, to alter a mans taſt at euery hand, and to haue it in ſubiection at all occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. Moreouer this kind of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, is not ſo much marked, nor troubleth any man with ceremonious refuſals, and exceedinglie befitteth a ciuil life. To put by one meat, and take another; to ſcrape and lick eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dishe, to find no meſſe well enough dreſſed for vs; to vſe cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies at euery morſell: betokeneth
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:5901:184"/> a nice nature, and too attentiue to the dishes and platters. I eſteeme more that of <hi>S.</hi> Bernard, who dranck oile in ſteed of water or wine, then yf he had dronck wormewood of purpoſe: for it was a plaine ſigne, that he thought not vpon that which he dranck. And in this careleſſneſſe of that which one ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth or drincketh, conſiſteth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect practize of this ſacred rule of our Saueour, <hi>Eate that which shalbe ſett before you.</hi> I except notwithſtanding ſuch meats as endamage our health, or trouble the ſpirit, as hotte meates doe to manie men, and ſuch as be ſpiced, fumie, and windie; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I except certaine occaſions, in which nature ſtandeth in need to be recreated, and ſtrengthened, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſome great labour for Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. A continuall and moderate ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie, is better then violent abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences, made at interrupted times, intermingled with manie recreations and refreshings.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Diſciplining the bodie likewiſe hath a merueilous efficacie, to ſtirre vp in vs a deſire of deuotion, when it is
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:5901:185" rendition="simple:additions"/> moderatly vſed. Haire-cloth tameth the fleſh very much, but the ordinarie vſe therof, is neither for married per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, nor delicate complexions, nor for ſuch as are exerciſed with painfull labours.

               <head>Of companie, and ſolitarineſſe. CHAPTER 24.</head>
               <p n="1">1. TO ſeeke companie, and vtterly to flie from it, are two extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes to be blamed in ciuil deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is that wherof I diſcourſe: for shunning all companie, ſauoureth of diſdaine and contempt of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: and ſeeking after it, ſmelleth of idlenes. We are bound to loue our neighbours as our ſelues, and to shew that we loue him, we muſt not flie from his companie: and to teſtifie that we loue our ſelues, we muſt take pleaſure with our ſelues when we are alone. <hi>Thinck firſt of thy ſelf</hi> (ſayth <hi>S.</hi> Bernard) <hi>and then of others.</hi> If then no reaſon or cauſe vrge thee, to enter into anie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, ſtay in thy ſelf, and conuerſe with
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:5901:186"/> thy owne hart: But yf companie chance thee, or any iuſt cauſe inuite thee to be preſent, go thether in Gods name Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotheus, &amp; ſee thy neighbour willingly and louingly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They call that euel conuerſation, which is kept for ſome euil intent: or when they that keep it, are vitious, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet, and diſſolute: and ſuch we muſt auoide, as the Bees do vſe to turne away from a ſwarme of Harnets or Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flies. For as they that are bitten by madd Dogges, haue their ſweat, breath, and ſpittle verie contagious, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallie daungerous for litle children, and for thoſe of delicate complexion: ſo vitious, vnmannerlie, and immodeſt perſons, cannot be frequented, but with hazard, and danger, and in eſpeciall by thoſe, whoſe deuotion is yet but tender and delicate.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There be ſome kind of conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, profitable for nothing, but for meere recreation, which are made by a ſimple turning or abſtracting of our minds from ſerious affaires: for ſuch, though a man muſt not be totallie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted vnto them, yet we may lend them
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:5901:187"/> ſo much leaſure, as is conuenient for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Other recreations, haue ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie and good reſpect for their end: as are mutuall viſitations, and certaine aſſemblies, made to do ſome honour to our neighbour. Touching theſe, as one should not be ſuperſtitious in practizing them, ſo one muſt not be vnciuil in contemning them, but ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie with modeſtie, the obligation, to eſchew equallie the note of lightnes, or ruſticitie.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There remaine now the profitable recreations, ſuch as are kept with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout, and virtuous perſons: O Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee, it will alway be an exceeding good turne for thee, to encounter oft times ſuch recreations. The vine planted by an Oliue-tree, beareth a fat kind of grape, that ſauoureth ſomething like the oliues: and a ſoule that happeneth to be in virtuous companie, cannot chooſe but be partaker of their good qualities. Drones cannot make honnie alone by them ſelues, but by the help of the Bees they make it: it is a great help for weake ſoules to exerciſe deuotion,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:5901:187"/> to conuerſe and haunt with vertuous perſons.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In all conuerſation and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, ſinceritie, ſimplicitie, ſweetnes, and modeſtie, are ſtill to be preferred. There be ſome ſo curious, that no one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they vſe, but is done ſo artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that they make the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie weerie; And as he that would not walk but tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his ſteppes, or neuer would ſpeak but ſinging, would be tedious to other men: ſo they that euer vſe an artificiall demeanour, and will do nothing but in print, trouble the companie in which they are, and are always ſubiect to ſome ſpice of preſumption. Let a modeſt myrthe for the moſt part predominate in our conuerſation. Saint Romuald, and Saint Anthonie are highlie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and admired, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their moſt rare auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, they had always their countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce pleaſant, and their words adorned with cheerfull alacritie. <hi>Reioice with them that reioice.</hi> I ſaye, once agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne with the Apoſtle: <hi>Reioice in our Lord always, againe I ſay, reioice: Let your modestie be knowne to all men.</hi>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:5901:188"/> To reioice in our Lord, it is needfull the cauſe of thy ioye be not onely lawfull, but honeſt alſo: and this I ſay, becauſe there are ſome things that be lawfull, which yet are not honeſt: And to the end that thy modeſtie may appeer, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe thy ſelf from all manner of inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, for it is alway blame worthie. To giue one a fall in ſport, to begrime ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers face, to pinche one, and ſuch tricks as theſe, are fond, foolish and inſolent meriments.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Beſides the mentall ſolitude, or ſpirituall hermitage whervnto, thou mayſt withdraw thy ſelf, euen amid the greateſt conuerſations that are (as I haue alreadie declared) thou muſt loue to be locallie, reallie and in verie deed ſolitarie: not to go to the deſart or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, as <hi>S.</hi> Marie of Egypt, Saint Paul, Saint Anthonie, Arſenius, and the other fathers of the deſart: but to be ſometime in thy garden, or in thy chamber, or els where, as thou likeſt beſt; where thou maiſt withdraw thy ſpirit into thy ſoule, and recreat they ſelfe with good thoughts, and holie conſiderations, or ſome ſpirituall le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:5901:188"/> according to the example of the great Nazianzen biſhop, who ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of him ſelf ſayth: <hi>I walked my ſelf with my ſelf about ſunn-ſetting, and paſſed the time vpon the ſea shore: for I accustomed to vſe this recreation, to eaſe my mind, and to shake of, at leaſt for a litle while, my ordinarie troubles.</hi> And vpon this point he diſcourſeth of the good meditation, which I declared vnto thee in another place; and according to the example of Saint Ambroſe, of whome Saint Auguſtin recounteth, that him ſelf entring oft times into Saint Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe his chamber (for entrance was denied to no man) he beheld him rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in ſilence; and expecting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, for feare of troubling him, he returned home without ſpeaking a word: thincking that the litle time which remained to this great Paſtour, for refreshing and recreating his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, after the multitude of his affaires, should in no wiſe be taken from him. So after the Apoſtles one day had told our Lord, how they had preached and laboured: <hi>Come</hi> (ſayd our Lord) <hi>into the deſart, and repoſe your ſelues a litle.</hi>

               <head>Of decency and handſomnes in attire. CHAPTER 25.</head>
               <p n="1">1. SAINT Paul admonisheth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout wemen (and the ſame muſt be vnderſtood of men) to be attired in decent apparell, clothing them ſelues with shamefaſtnes and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie. Now then the decencie of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, and other ornaments, depende of their matter, fashion, and cleanlines. Touching cleanlines, it should almoſt allwayes be a like in our apparel, vpon which as near as may be, we should not permitt anie kind of vncomely foulnes, or ſlouenrie. Exteriour neatnes ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie ſignifieth the inward cleanneſſe of the ſoule. God him ſelf requireth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall cleanlyneſſe, in thoſe that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proache nigh his altar, and haue the principall charge and care of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the ſtuffe, and fashion of attire the comlines, and decencie therof is to be examined and conſidered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to manie circumſtances, of
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:5901:189"/> time, age, eſtate, companie, occaſion. Men apparell them ſelues ordinarily better vpon feſtiuall dayes, according to the ſolemnitie of the feaſt which is celebrated. In time of penaunce as in lent, they rather humble and abaſe them ſelues: at weddings they put on wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-garments, at burialls, moorning robes; with princes men ſette foorth them ſelues according to their eſtate, at home they vſe themſelues more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely. The married woman may, and muſt adorne her ſelf in her housbands preſence, when he deſireth it: but yf ſhe doeth ſo in his abſence, one might aske her, whoſe eyes she meant to pleaſe with that particular care? The manner is to permitte more gallant ornaments to young maidens: becauſe they may lawfullie deſire to pleaſe manie, with intent honeſtlie to winne one alone for holie marriage. Neither is it eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med amiſſe that widowes, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d marriage, deck vp themſelues hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomlie: ſo that they shew no lightnes or fondmes in their attire; for hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redie been married, and charged with gouernement of a familie, and paſſed
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:5901:190"/> the mourning ſtate of widowhood: they are held to be, and indeed should be, of a more ripe and ſetled iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But as for thoſe which are wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes indeed, not onely in bodie, but in hart and purpoſe, no ornament bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter becommeth them then humilitie, modeſtie and deuotion: for yf they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to allure men with their brauerie, they are not true widowes; and yf it be not their intention to allure men, why do they vſe ſuch inſtruments? He that will not receaue gueſts in his inne, muſt pull downe the ſigne from his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. Old folke be always ridiculous, when they will play tricks of youth: for theſe follies are not to be tolerated, but only in young perſons.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be handſome Philotheus, and ſuffer nothing about thee to traile vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decentlie, or to ſitt out of order: we dishonour them with whome we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe, to come into their companie in vncomelie apparell. But take heed withal of wantonneſſe, curioſities, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, and vanities. As farre as thou art able, keep thy ſelf always on plaine ſimplicities ſide: for modeſtie without
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:5901:190"/> duplicitie is the greateſt ornament of beautie, and the beſt excuſe for hard-fauour.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Saint Peter aduertiſed young wemen eſpecially, that they should not wear their treſſes of their haire curled, frizled, toured, and tormented, as now is the ordinarie fashion: but yf men should affect ſuch fondnes in their owne locks, they should iuſtlie be ſtiled effeminate perſons. Euen vaine women, giuen to theſe toyes affectiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlie, are counted ſcant of chaſtitie, or yf they haue anie, it is not perceiued among ſo manie fooleries. They ſay they haue no ill meaning in it. But I replie (as I haue elſe where ſayd) that the diuel hath enough in it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I would haue my frind whome I affect, to be apparelled beſt of all the companie: but yet with the leaſt pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe and curioſitie; and, (as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie ſay) that he were adorned with good cariage, comelines, and worthines.

Whenſoeuer therfore thou art to ſpeak of God, and of deuotion, do it not ſlightly, by way of common talke, but with attention, and care: which I ſay, to take from thee a notable vanitie, that is to be found in manie that make profeſſion of deuotion: who at euerie occaſion abound in holie and feruou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous words, vpon a kind of brauerie, litle minding in hart, that which they ſpeak with their mouthes: and after they haue ſpoken ſuch ſpirituall bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueries, they imagine them-ſelues to be ſuch, as their great words ſeeme to make boaſt; which indeed is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo.</p>

YF <hi>any ſinneth not in word</hi> (ſayth. <hi>S.</hi> Iames) <hi>he is a perfect man.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware thou let not fall any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly word, for although it proceed not from thee with an ill intention, yet they that heare it, may interpret it farre otherwiſe. An vnſeemlie word ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard by a weak and feeble hart, ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and enlargeth it ſelf like a droppe of oyle, falling vpon a peece of cloth: and ſometime it ſo ſeazeth vpon the hart, that it filleth it with a thouſand, vncleane thoughts and imaginations; For as the poiſon, which infecteth the bodie, entreth by the mouth: ſo the poiſon which intoxicateth the ſoule, entreth by the eare: and the tongue which produceth this poiſon is a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer. For although peraduenture the poiſon which it hath ſpitte foorth, hath not wrought his effect, becauſe it found the harts of the hearers fortified with ſome preſeruatiue: yet there was no
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:5901:192"/> want of malice on his part, to committ the murther. And let noe man excuſe him ſelf by ſaying, that he, for his part, thought no harme: for our Lord, who knoweth mens thoughts, hath ſayd: <hi>That out of the aboundance of the hart the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi> And though we thinck no harme in doing or ſaying ſo, yet the deuil thincketh a great deale: and oft times doth ſecretlie make vſe of thoſe wicked words to wound the hart of ſome feeble hearer. They ſay, ſuch as haue eaten the hearbe called Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica, haue allways a ſweet pleaſaunt breath: and they that haue honeſtie and chaſtitie (which is the virtue of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels) in their harts, haue their words allwayes pure, ciuil, and chaſt. As for indecencies and ſcurrilities, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle will not once haue them named among vs, aſſuring vs, that nothing: <hi>ſo much corrupteth good manners, as wicked talke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Yf theſe vnſeemly words be vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red cunninglie, with willie conceipts, or ſubtil curioſitie, then are they farre more venimous. For as a Dart, the sharper it is, the more eaſilie it pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:5901:192"/> our bodie: ſo the more sharpe and wittily that a wanton or vnſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie word is couched in conuerſation, the deeper it penetrateth into our harts. And they that eſteeme them ſelues gallant felowes, for multiplying ſuch vnſeemlie ieſts in conuerſation, know not indeed wherfore conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations are ordained; for they should be like ſwarmes of Bees, gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to make honnie of ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt and virtuous entertainment, and not like a multitude of Waſpes, who come together to ſuck ſome vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourie carrion. Yf any bad compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſpeake ſome misbeſeeming words vnto thee, declare that thine eares be offended therwith, either turning thy ſelf to ſome other matter, or leauing the companie, or by ſome other meanes, which thy pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and diſcretion shall dictate vnto thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is one of the woorſt conditions that a man can haue, to be a ſcoffer. God himſelf profeſſeth extreame ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt this vice, and hath made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſtrange punishments alredie therof.
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:5901:193"/> Nothing is ſo contrarie to charitie, and eſpeciallie to deuotion, as the deſpiſing and contemning of our neighbour: but deriſon and mockerie, is neuer wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout this contempt, and therfore it is a grieueous ſinne: ſo that the Doctours do ſay with great reaſon, that ſcoffing and flouting, is one of the greateſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences that a man can committ againſt his neighbour, by words: for other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences are committed always with ſome reſpect, and intereſt of the offender, but this is donne onely of meere diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pight and contempt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As for ieſting wordes, which be ſpoken one to another, with modeſt and cheerfull myrthe, they proceed from a virtue called <hi>Eutrapelia</hi> by the Greeks, which we may call, good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation: by which we take an honeſt and pleaſaunt recreation, vpon friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous occaſions, which humane imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections do offer: onely this we muſt beware, leaſt from this honeſt myrthe, we paſſe to immodeſt ſcoffing and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are the iudgements of the children of men rashe, and temerarious, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe they are not iudges one of another, ſo that in iudging they vſurpe and arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te to them ſelues the office that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and peculiar to our Lord. They be rashe likewiſe, becauſe the principall malice and wickedneſſe which is in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, dependeth of the intentions and councells of the hart, which is a dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke and vnſearcheable dungeon for our eyes. They be rashe, becauſe euery one hath enough to doe to iudge his owne ſelfe, he neede not vndertake withall to iudge his neighbour. Not to iudge others, and to iudge our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, are two thinges equallie neceſſarie for vs, not to be iudged our ſelues: for as our bleſſed Lord forbiddeth vs the one, ſo his holy Apoſtle inioineth vs the other, ſaying that. <hi>Yf we did iudge ourſelues, we should not be iudged.</hi> But ô good God, we doe quite contrarie: that which is forbid vs, we ceaſe not

               <p n="2">2. The remedies againſt this vice of rashe iudging, muſt be applied accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diuerſitie of cauſes, from whence rashe iudgements vſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Some men there are of ſo sharpe and ſower a condition by nature, that whatſoeuer they receaue, turnes bitter in their harts, chaunging <hi>iugdement</hi> (as the prophet ſayth) <hi>into wormewood, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer iudging their neighbour, but with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and bitterneſſe.</hi> Such men haue great neede of the help of ſome ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall phyſician, that may teach them how to vanquish this bitterneſſe of hart which becauſe it is naturall vnto them, is hardly amended: And though in it ſelf it be no ſinne, but onely an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, yet is it verie daungerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cauſeth this vice of rash iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to raigne in the hart. Other ſome iudge rashely not for harshenes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but of meere pride, imagining that by diminishing and ſuppreſſing
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:5901:195"/> other mens honour, they aduaunce and increaſe their owne, arrogant, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſpirits, which admire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and place them ſelues ſo high in their owne eſtimation, that they hold all men in compariſon of them, to be abiect, baſe, and of no worth at all: ſo ſayd the fond phariſey in the ghoſpell, <hi>I am not as other men.</hi> Some there are that haue not in them this manifeſt pride, but onely of a vaine complacence or delight which they haue in their owne excellence, conſider other mens imperfections, to taſt (as it were) with more content the contrarie perfections wherwith they preſume the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be endowed. This ſelf-pleaſing conceipt is ſo ſecret, and ſo hard to be percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that vnleſſe one haue great inſight in diſeaſes of the ſoule, he can not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer it: and they themſelues that are ſick of it, do not know it, vntill it be shewed vnto them. Other there be, that to flatter, and excuſe them ſelues, and to mitigate the remorſe of their owne guiltie conſciences, gladly iudge other men faultie in the ſame vice, wherunto they feele themſelues to be addicted,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:5901:195"/> as yf the multitude of offenders made their ſinnes leſſe to be blamed. Many giue themſelues to iudge rashly of others, onely of a vaine pleaſure which they take, to diſcourſe, and prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate other mens humours, and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueours, exerciſing their witts, at the coſt of theire neighbours credit and good name. And yf by miſchaunce they chaunce to gieſſe aright in their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: they wilbe bold thereafter in like iudgements, that one shall verie hardly draw them from this follie. Others iudge of paſſion, thincking that beſt which they loue, and that ſtark naught which they hate: ſauing in one caſe onely admirable, yet true, and daylie experienced; whetin the exceſſe of loue maketh men iudge ill of that which thy loue; A monſtrous effect, proceeding allwaies from an impure and ſenſuall loue, troubled and ſick with iealouſie, which as euerie man knoweth, vpon a bare looke, vpon the leaſt ſmile in the word, condemneth the party beloued of diſloyaltie, or adulterie. To conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, feare, ambition, and other ſuch like defectiue paſſions, and diſeaſes of
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:5901:196"/> the minde do ordinarilie contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the oreeding of ſuſpicions and rashe iudgements.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But what remedies do we preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be to this diſeaſe? There is an hearbe in Ethopia, called Ophiuſa, the iuice wherof being drunck, maketh men imagin, that they ſee themſelues all enuironed with hotrible ſerpents: ſo they that haue ſwallowed downe pride, enuie, ambition, &amp; hatred, imagin all things which they ſee, to be faultie and defectiue. Theſe to be healed, muſt drinck wine made of palmes, and theſe others muſt drinck as much as they can of the ſacred wine of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and it will purge them of theſe naughtie humours, which cauſe them to make ſuch rashe and peruerſe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Charitie feareth to meet with euill, ſo farre of is she from ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it; when she meeteth with it, she turneth away her face, and maketh as yf she ſaw it not; nay at the firſt noiſe of euill, she shutteth her eyes that she may not ſee it: &amp; afterward with a holy ſimplicitie beleeueth, that it was not euil, but onely the shadow or likenes of
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:5901:196"/> euill. And yf by no meanes she ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> excuſe it, but euidently ſeeth it to be euill, she turneth away her ſight, &amp; endeuoureth preſently to forget the ouglie shape therof. Charitie is the ſoueraigne reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die againſt al euils but eſpecially againſt this. All things ſeeme yealowe to their eyes that are ſick of the iaunders, and they ſay, to heale them, they muſt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the hearbe Celydonia vnder the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of their feet. The ſinne of rashe iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, is a ſpirituall iaunders, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all things appeere reprehenſible to their eyes that be infected therwith: he that wilbe cured of it, muſt applie the remedies not to his eyes, nor to his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but to his affections, which are the feet of the ſoule. Yf thy affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be mild, &amp; gentle, ſuch will thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of things be: yf thy affections be charitable, thy iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wil alſo be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable. I preſent vnto thee three admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable examples; Iſaac had ſayde that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca was his ſiſter: Abimelech ſaw him playing with her, that is making verie much of her, &amp; he iudged perſently that she was his wife: a naughtie eye would rather haue iudged her to haue been
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:5901:197"/> his ſtroumpet, or yf she were his ſiſter, that he had been inceſtuous. But Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech, folowed the moſt charitable opinion, that he could gather of ſuch an action. We muſt alway do the like (my Philotheus) as much as is poſſible, in cenſuring our neighbours actions: and yf one action had a hundred faces, we should always caſt our ſight vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faireſt. Our Ladie was great with child, and <hi>S.</hi> Ioſeph perceaued it well enough; but becauſe on the other ſide he ſaw her to be pure, holy, and of an Angelicall life, he could not beleeue that she came to be with child otherwiſe then became her ſainctitie, in ſo much that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to forſake her ſecretly, and leaue the iudgement of hir innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to God, though the appeeraunce of the thing, was a violent argument to make him conceaue an ill opinion of the Virgin, yet would not he iudge her, leaſt he should iudge rashely. And why ſo? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (ſayth the ſpirit of God) he was iuſt. A iuſt man, when he can no longer excuſe neither the action, nor the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of him, whome otherwiſe he knoweth to be an honeſt man: yet will
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:5901:197"/> not he iudge of the matter, but wipeth the remembrance of it out of his mind, and leaueth it for God to iudge. Nay our bleſſed Sauiour vpon the croſſe, though he could not altogeather excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe the ſinne of them that crucified him: yet did he diminishe the malice of it, alledging their ignorance. When <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> cannot excuſe the ſinne it ſelf, let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> leaſt (according to our Lords example) make it worthie of compaſſion, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting it to the moſt tolerable cauſe we may, as to ignorance or infirmitie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But what? may we neuer iudge of our neighbour? no verely: neuer. It is onely God that iudgeth, euen when malefactours are iudged in publique tribunals True it is, that he vſeth the magiſtrats voice, to make him ſelf the better vnderſtood by vs: they be his interpretours, and ought, to pronounce nothing, but what they haue learned of him, as being his oracles: But yf they doe otherwiſe, folowing their owne paſſions, then it is they indeed that iudge, and conſequently shalbe iudged. For men are forbidden, as they are men, to iudge any man.</p>
               <pb n="410" facs="tcp:5901:198"/>
               <p n="5">5. To ſee or know a thing, is not to iudge or cenſure it: for iudgement, at leaſt according to the ſcriptures phraſe, preſuppoſeth ſome true or appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie to be ended: and this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that manner of ſpeeche, in which our Sauiour ſayth, that they which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue not, are allreadie iudged; becauſe there is no doubt of their damnation. Is it not lawfull the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to doubt of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? it is not always vnlawfull, for we are not forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to doubt, but to iudge: yet muſt we neither doubt nor ſuſpect our neighbour, but when force of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and euident arguments, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine: otherwiſe euen doubts, and ſuſpicions, are rashe and temerarious. Yf ſome ſuſpicious eye had ſeen Iaacob kiſſe Rachel by the well, or Rebecca re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue earings and braceletts at Eliezers hands, being a man vnknowne in that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie: he would doubtleſſe haue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght ill, of theſe two rare paternes of chaſtitie; but without ſufficient cauſe or ground; for when the action is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent of it ſelf, it is rashe ſuſpicion to draw badde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence from it, vnleſſe manie circumſtances giue force to the
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:5901:198"/> argument. It is alſo a rashe iudgemente, to drawe an argument from the action, to blame the perſon; of which we will by and by ſpeak more cleerly.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To be brieffe, all men that haue diligent care of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, are not much ſubiect to make rashe iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of other mens matters. For as Bees in foggie miſtes, or cloudie weather retire to their hiues, to buſie them ſelues with their honny: ſo the thoughts of deuour ſoules, neuer wander abroade to cenſure or to marke the doubtfull and ſecret actions or intentions of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: but leaſt they should by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them, fall in danger of cenſuring them, they retire them ſelues by a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full introuerſion (as ſpirituall men call it) into them ſelues, there in the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet of their ſoules, to view and order the good reſolutions of their owne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is the part of an idle and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriftie ſoule, to buſie her ſelf in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge other mens liues: excepted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuch as haue charge of others, as well in common wealths, as in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat families, and communities: for a

O that I had one of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning coales of the holy altar, to touch therwith the lippes of men, and take away their iniquities, and cleanſe their ſinne: imitating the Seraphin, that puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the mouth of the prophet Eſay, with a coale take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the altar of God: for he that could bannishe ſlaunderous

Slaunder is a kind of willfull and perfidious murther: for we haue three liues, one ſpirituall which conſiſteth in the graces of God: another corporall, which cometh fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſoule; the third a ciuil or morall life, which conſiſteth in our good name; ſinne robbeth vs of the firſt, death taketh from vs the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and an ill tongue depriueth vs of the thirde.

It ſeemes theſe felowes do drawe their tongues to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, but it is onely to let them ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoot with greater violence, and pierce more profoundlie into the harts of the audience, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie where they talke. Detractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vttered in a ieſting &amp; ſcoffing manner, is yet more wicked then the

               <p n="5">5. Doe not ſay, ſuch a one is a dronc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, allthough thou haue ſeen him dronck: nor, he is an adulterer, though thou haue ſeen him taken in that ſinne; nor, that ſuch a one is an inceſtuous perſon, becauſe he hath beene once found in that crime: for one onely act giueth not name &amp; title to a thing. The ſunne ſtood ſtil once in behalf of Ioſuas victorie; and loſt his light another time
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:5901:201"/> for our Saueours death vpon the croſſe: yet for all that, no man will ſay that the ſunne is immoueable, or darkſome. Noah was once dronck; and Lot ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, and withall committed hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible inceſt with his owne daughters; yet neither the one, nor the other were drunckardes: nor was the latter an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous perſon. So Saint Peter was not a bloud shedder, though once he shed bloud: nor a blaſphemer, though once he blaſphemed. To beare the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of a vice or a virtue, one muſt haue frequented the actes therof, and gotten a habit of it: ſo that it is an abuſe of tearmes, to ſay, one is cholerick, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe we haue once ſeene him angrie, or a theefe, becauſe he hath once ſtollen.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Although a man haue beene a long time vitious, yet we incurre daunger of lying, to tearme him a vitious man. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the leaper, called Marie Magdalen a ſinner, becauſe she had beene ſo not long before: yet lied he, for she was then no longer a ſinner, but a moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and bleſſed penitent, and therfore our Lord himſelf took vpon him the defence of her cauſe. The preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:5901:202"/> phariſey held the humble publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can for a ſinner, peraduenture for an vniuſt oppreſſer, a fornicatour, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to ſome other hainous vice: but he was foulie deceaued, for when he thought ſo badlie of him, at that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie time was he iuſtified. Alas ſeinge the goodnes of God is ſo great, that one moment ſuffizeth to obtaine and receaue his holie grace, what aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce can we haue, that he, who yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day was a ſinner, remaineth a ſinner to day? The day paſt, muſt not iudge the day preſent: nor the preſent, iudge the day to come: it is onelie the laſt day, that iudgeth all dayes. Thus we ſee, that we can neuer ſay a man is naught, without probable daunger of lying: that which we may ſay, in caſe that we muſt needs ſpeak, is, that he did ſuch a naughtie act, he liued ill ſuch a time; he doth ill for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: but we may drawe no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from yeſterday, to this day, nor from this day, to the morrow folowing.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now though we should be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous carefull, neuer to ſpeak ill of
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:5901:202"/> our neighbour, yet muſt we take heed of the other extremitie, into which ſome do fall, who to auoide ill ſpeaking, commend and ſpeak well of vice. Yf thou meete with one that is indeed a ſlaunderer of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, doe not ſay, as it were excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge his vice, that he ſpeaketh his minde francklie, and freelie; Of one that is notoriouſlie vaine and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gante, ſay not, that he is a gallaunt courtlie gentleman: dangerous fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities, muſt not be tearmed plaine and ſimple dealings; maske not diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, with the name of zeale; nor pride with the name of magnanimitie; ſtile not laſciuiouſneſſe with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt title of frindship; No, my deere Philotheus, thinck not that thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoideſt the vice of ill-ſpeaking, by fauouring, flattering, and cheriſhing other men in their vices: but round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and freelie, ſpeak ill of euill, and blame that which is blame-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, for in ſo doing we glorifie God; ſo it be done with the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions folowing.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To reprehend another mans faultes
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:5901:203"/> and vices lawfullie, it is needfull, that it be profitable to him of whome wee ſpeake, or to them vnto whome we ſpeake. There be ſome, that recite before maydens, indiſcreet priuities of ſuch and ſuch, which be manifeſtlie daungerous, others recount, ſome mans diſſolute geſtures, or wanton ſpeeches, tending manifeſtlie to dishoneſtie; yf I should not freelie reprehend this abuſe, or that I should excuſe it, theſe tender young ſoules who heare it, would take thereby occaſion, to giue them ſelues leaue to ſay, and to do the like. Their profit then requireth, that I rebuke ſuch thinges freelie, before I ſturre from the place, vnleſſe I may prudentlie deferre this good office, to doe it with more deliberation, and leſſe intereſt of them, of whome thoſe things were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, at an other occaſion.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Moreouer it is requiſite, that in ſome ſort it belong vnto me to ſpeak of that matter, as when I am one of the principall of the companie, and that yf I ſpeake not, it would ſeeme that I approue their vices: But yf I be one of the meaner ſort, then I muſt
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:5901:203"/> not vndertake to giue the ſentence.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But aboue all it is requiſite, that I be exact, and warie in my words, and not to vſe one too much: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, yf I blame the familiaritie of this young man, and that young mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, and call it indiſcreet and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; O God (my Philotheus) we muſt hold the ballance verie euen, that we make not things heauier then they be indeed, allthough it be but the waight of a graine. Yf in the fault I am to ſpeak of, there be but only a bare appeeraunce, I will ſay no more then ſo: yf but a ſimple indiſcretion, I will giue it no worſe name; yf neither indiſcretion, nor probable appeeraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of ill be in the matter, ſauing one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſome malicious ſpirit may ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by take occaſion to ſpeak ill, I will ſay nothing at al, or onely ſay the ſame. My to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue ſo long as I iudge my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, is like a raſour in a chirurgians hands, that pretends to cut between the ſinews and the veines: ſo the cutt that I make with my tongue in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring or reprehending my neighbours actions muſt be ſo warie, that I launce
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:5901:204"/> no deeper then needs, that I ſpeak nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor leſſe, then that which the thing it ſelf indeed requireth. And in a word, be carefull to keep this rule, that in reprehending the vice as it deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, thou ſpare the perſon, in whome it is, as much as diſcretion and ciuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie teacheth.</p>
               <p n="10">10. True it is, that of infamous and notorious publique ſinners, wee may ſpeake more freelie: ſo that ſtill we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in our words, the ſpirit of charitie and compaſſion, without all arrogancie or preſumption, nor taking delight in other folks miſeries, which is always an affection proceeding from a baſe &amp; abiect hart. I except allways thoſe that are denounced to be Gods enemies and deſloyall to his holie churche: for we may and ought in conſcience diſgrace, and debaſe all hereticall and ſchiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſectes, and the authours of them: it is charitie to crie againſt the wolfe, not only when he is among the sheep, but whenſoeuer we eſpie him.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Euery one is bold to take ſo much licence as to cenſure princes, and ſpeak ill of whole nations, according
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:5901:204"/> to the diuerſitie of affections that men beare them: but thou (my Philotheus) muſt beware alſo of this defect: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that God is offended therwith, it may raiſe thee vp a thouſand quarrels, from which thou canſt not deliuer thy ſelf, without great vnquietnes.</p>
               <p n="12">12. When thou chaunceſt to heare any man ſpeak ill of another, procure yf thou canſt, to make his accuſation doubtfull: yf thou canſt not doe that iuſtlie, endeuour to excuſe the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the partie cenſured: yf that cannot be done neither; shew thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion toward his frailtie, cut off the diſcourſe remembring thy ſelfe, and bringing the hearers in remembrance, that yf they haue not offended in that ſort, that they are the more beholding to the grace of God for the ſame, and withall recall courteouſly the detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour to him ſelfe: and laſtly yf thou knoweſt any good of the partie detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, endeuour to ſet it foorthe.</p>

LET our talke be courteous, franck, ſincere, plaine, &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: without double dealing, ſubtiltie, or diſſembling; for though it be not good alway to tell the truth in all matters, and in all occaſions: yet is it neuer lawfull to ſpeak againſt the truth. Accuſtom thy ſelf neuer to lie wittinglie, and of ſet purpoſe, neither to excuſe thy ſelf, nor for any other cauſe, calling alwais to mind, that God is the God of truth. Yf thou chaunce to tell a lie, and canſt handſomly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it out of hand, either by recalling it merily, or by ſome good explication, doe it: a true excuſe, hath much more grace and force to giue ſatisfaction, then a lie neuer ſo ſmoothlie tolde.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though ſometime a man may prudently and diſcreetly diſguiſe and couer the truth, by ſome artificiall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of ſpeeche, yet muſt that be vſed only in matters of importance, when
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:5901:205"/> the glorie and ſeruice of God manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly requireth it. Excepting onely thoſe occaſions, ſuch artificiall equiuocation is daungerous, for as holy writt ſayeth: <hi>the holy Ghoſt dwelleth not in a diſſembling and double ſpirit:</hi> No cunning is ſo much to be deſired as ſimplicitie; the wiſdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of the worlde, and ſubtilitie of the fleshe, belong to the children of this world: but the children of God, walk plainely, without going awrie, their hart is free from all doublenes. <hi>He that walketh ſimply</hi> (ſayth the wiſeman) <hi>wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth confidently.</hi> Liyng, double dealing, &amp; diſſembling, are allways ſignes of a weak, and baſe ſpirit <hi>S.</hi> Auſtin had ſayd in the 4. booke of his Confeſſions, that his ſoule, and his frinds ſoule, were but one ſoule; and that his life was te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious vnto him after the death of his frind, becauſe he would not liue by by halfes; and yet that for the ſelf ſame cauſe he feared to die, leaſt his frind should die wholly in him. Theſe words afterward, ſeemed vnto him too artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, and affected, in ſo much that he corrected them in the bookes of his Retractations, cenſuring them with a

Surely it is a great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of a chriſtian ſoule to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, plaine, and ſincere in talk: I haue ſayd, <hi>I will obſerue and keep my wayes; that I may not offend in my tongue.

But in what occaſions may a man vſe dancing and ſportings. The iuſt occaſions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differente diſportes are moſt frequent: occaſions of vnlawfull are verie rare, and ſuch games are much more blame wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie and dangerous.

And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue no leſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, when I find her in her fathers kitchin making the fire, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſpitt, dreſſing meat, kneading bread, &amp; doinge all the low &amp; baſer offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the houſe, with a courage full of louing delight in her God.

Our words muſt be taken in good part, and yet we are captious &amp; cauill preciſely at other mens ſpeaches. We would haue our neighbour leaue vs his goods for our monie: but is it not more reaſonable, that he should keep his goods, leauing vs our monie? we are diſcontented with him, becauſe he will not helpe vs to his owne in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie: is it not more reaſon we should reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d our ſelues, for deſiring to hinder his commoditie?</p>

               <p n="1">1. MARIAGE <hi>is a great Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſay in Ieſus-Chriſt and in his churche; it is honourable to all, amongſt all, and in all:</hi> that is, in all the partes and circumſtances therof; to all, becauſe euen the virgins, them ſelues ought to reuerence it with humilitie: amongſt all, becauſe it is equallie holy in rich, and in poore: in all, becauſe the beginning, the end and intention, the commodities and profits, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me and matter of it, all are holie. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:5901:219"/> is the nurſerie of Chriſtianitie, which peopleth the earth with faithfull ſoules, to accomplish the number of the elect in heauen: ſo that the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of all the rights and lawes of the holy eſtate of wedlock, is moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie in the common wealth, as the ſpring and fountaine, of all theſe riuers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Would to God that his moſt deer Sonne were inuited to all marriages, as he was to the marriage in Cana: for then the pretious wine of bleſſing and conſolation, should neuer want: and yf in ordinarie weddings we find but a litle of that ſweet wine, it is becauſe Adonis is inuited to the wedding feaſt, in ſteed of our Saueour, and Venus in ſteed of our Ladie. He that would haue his lambes faire and parti-coloured as Iacobs were, muſt imitate his indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie, and preſent parti-coloured roddes to the ewes when they aſſemble to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue: and he that would enioy a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie ſucceſſe of his marriage, should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways place before his eyes the ſanctitie, and excellence of this Sacrament. But alas inſteed of theſe, ordinarilie we ſee
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:5901:220"/> arriue a thouſand diſorders in paſtimes, feaſtinge, and vnſeemly talking: and therfore no meruaile, yf the ſucceſſe of their mariages be diſordered.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore I exhort all thoſe which are in the holie eſtate of wedlock, that they loue one another with that mutual loue, which the holy Ghoſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſo much in the ſcripture. It is not enough to ſay to married folk, that they should loue one another with a naturall loue, for ſo do the Turtle doues: not with a humane loue, for the verie pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims haue wel practiſed that ſort of loue: but I ſay with the great Apoſtle: <hi>You that are married, loue your wiues, as Ieſus Chriſt loued his church: and you wiues loue your housbands, as the church loueth her Sauiour.</hi> It was God that brought Eue to our firſt father Adam, and gaue him her for his wife: it is alſo the ſelf ſame God, who with his inuiſible hand, hath tied the knot of the holie band of your marriage, and hath giuen you po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer one ouer the other: why then should you not one cherish the other, with a holy, ſupernaturall, and diuine loue?</p>
               <pb n="455" facs="tcp:5901:220"/>
               <p n="4">4. The firſt effect of this loue, is the inſeparable vnion of your harts. Two peeces of firre tree glewed togeather, cleaue ſo faſt one to the other, that you may ſooner break the whole peece in any other place, then in that part in which they were glued. But God ioined man to woman in his owne bloud, for which cauſe this vnion is ſo ſtrong, that rather the ſoule should forſake the bodie, then the husband be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his wife: and vnderſtand this inſeparable vnion which I ſpeak of, not onely of the bodie, but principallie of the ſoule, and ſincere affection of the hart.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſecond effect of this loue is inuiolable loyaltie, of the one partie to the other. In old time men vſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue their ſeales vpon the rings which they wore continuallie, as the holie ſcripture it ſelf doth teſtifie: and from this cuſtom of antiquitie may we drawe a fitt interpretation of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie which holie Church vſeth in the Sacrament of marriage. For the prieſt halowinge the wedding ringe, and giuing it firſt to the man, proteſteth
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:5901:221"/> that this holy Sacrament ſo ſealeth and cloſeth his hart, that neuer after the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me or loue of anie other woman, may lawfullie enter into it, ſo long as she li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, whome God hath giuen vnto him. And the husband preſently putteth the ring vpon his wiues finger, that shee likewiſe may vnderſtand, that her hart is now ſealed and shutt vp, from loue or though of any other man, ſo long as he liueth, whome there our Saueour giueth vnto her.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The third fruit of matrimonial loue, is the lawfull generation, and the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full education of children. It is an in explicable honour to you that are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, that God by his omnipotent po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, determining to multiplie reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſoules, which might praiſe him for euer, would make you as it were his feelow labourers in ſo worthie a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, giuing you the priuiledge &amp; honor to engender bodies, into the which he diſtilles the new created ſoule, like ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall dropes into the bodies.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Conſerue then, you housbands, a tender, conſtant, and hartie loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your wiues: for therefore was the
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:5901:221"/> woman taken from the ſide of man, and next his hart, that she should be beloued of him hartylie and tenderly. The infirmities of your wiues, corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or ſpirituall, muſt not prouoke you to any diſdaigne or loathing of them, but rather to a ſweet and louely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion: ſince God therfore created them, that depending always on you, you should therby be more honoured, &amp; reſpected; and that you should haue them in ſuch ſort for your companions that neuertheleſſe you should be their heads and ſuperiours. And you, ô wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, loue your husbands tenderlie &amp; hartelie, but let your loue befull of reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and reuerence, for therefore did God create them of a ſex more vigou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and predominant; therfore did he ordaine that a woman should be a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man, bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh; and that she should be made of a ribbe of his, and taken from vnder his arme, to teache her, that she should be vnder the hand and guiding of her husband: and holy ſcripture verie ſtraightly recomme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vnto you this ſubiection: which notwithſtanding the
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:5901:222"/> ſelf ſame ſcripture maketh ſweet and delectable vnto you; not onely adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing you to accept therof with loue and affection, but preſcribing alſo vnto your husbands, how they should exerciſe their authoritie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund ouer you, with all patience, meeknes, and gentle ſufferance: <hi>Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſbands</hi> (ſayth Saint Peter) <hi>behaue your ſelues diſcreetlie towards your wiues, as weaker veſſels, bearing them honour and reſpect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. But while I exhort you more and more to increaſe this holy mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall loue, which you owe one to another, beware you chaunge it not into iealouſie. For as wormes breed ordinarilie in the ripeſt and delicateſt apples: ſo manie times it happines, that iealouſie groweth from ardent and exceſſliue loue, betweene man and wife, and marreth and corrupteth the verie pithe and ſubſtance of the holie ſtate of wedlock, breeding by litle and litle, troubleſome braules, diſſentions, and diuorcements. This iealouſie hath no place where mutuall loue is grounded vpon true virtue:
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:5901:222"/> and therfore it is an infallible marke of a loue, in part at leaſt groſſe and ſenſuall, which hath mette with a weake and inconſtante virtue, and ſubiect to miſtruſt and ſuſpect. And it is a verie vaine boaſtinge of loue, to make it ſeeme greate, by beinge iealous: for iealouſie may well be a ſigne of great and ardent loue, but not of pure, perfect and conſtant amitie: for the perfection of frind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and true loue, preſuppoſeth the aſſured foundation of true virtue, and iealouſie preſuppoſeth the vncertaintie of the ſame.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Yf you deſire, ô husbandes, that your wiues be faithfull vnto you, giue them a leſſon of this loyaltie by your owne example. <hi>With what face</hi> (ſayth Saint Gregory Naziazen) <hi>can you exact chaſtity of your wiues, when you your ſelues liue vncleanly? how can you require of them, that which you giue them not? Will you haue them chaſt in deed? behaue your ſelues chaſtly: And,</hi> (as Saint Paul ſayth) <hi>let euery man, knowe how to poſseſſe
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:5901:223"/> his owne veſſelin ſanctification. For yf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this doctrine of the Apoſtle, you your ſelues teach them looſe behaueour, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton trickes, no meruall yf you receaue disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by loſſe of their honeſty: But you (ô wemen) whoſe honour and reputation is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably ioined with your honeſtie and chastitie, be tealouſe (in a manner) of this your glorie, and ſuffer no kind of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, to blemish your credit and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. You that deſire to haue the name and merit of chaſt and worthie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, flie all kind of aſſaultes, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of courting, be it neuer ſo litle: ſuffer not any wanton geſtures nigh you: ſuſpect him, whoſoeuer he be, that commendeth your beautie, and good grace: for he that earne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly praiſeth marchandize which he is not able to buy, giues a shrewd ſuſpicion, that he meaneth to ſteale it. But yf iointlie with praiſes of your beautie, any man diſcommend your husbands, deteſt him as one that offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth you hainous iniurie; for it is euident, that ſuch a one not onely ſeeketh your ruine and ouerthrow,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:5901:223"/> but accounteth you alredie half ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: becauſe we ſee ordinarilie, that the bargaine is half made with the ſecond chap man, when the firſt diſpleaſeth the merchant. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, as well in time paſt, as now a dayes, weare manie pearles in their eares, delighted (as Plinie thought) with the prettie ratling noiſe which they make, in touching one another. Why they wore them I care not, I thinck verelie Iſaac, that great ſeruant and frind of God, ſent pretious earings as the firſt pledge of his loue, to the faire and chaſt Rebecca, as a myſticall ornament betokening, that the firſt part which a husband should take poſſeſſion of in his wife, muſt be her eares, which his wife should loyallie keep onely for her housbands vſe: to the end that no ſpeech or rumour should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therin, but onelie the ſweet amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſound of honeſt and chaſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, which are the orient pearls of the holy ghoſpell; for we muſt all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remember that which before I haue ſayd, that our ſoules are empoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:5901:224"/> by the eare, as the bodie by the mouthe.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Loue and loyaltie ioined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cauſe a conſtant and fearleſſe aſſurance; and therfore the Saints of God preſuppoſing this fidelitie, haue vſed alwais moſt kind ſignes and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of their mutuall loue: ſweet, and louing fauours, but yet chaſt and honeſt; tender, and kind har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but yet ſincere, plaine, and beſeeming their graue ſimplicitie. So Iſaac and Rebecca, the chaſteſt maried couple of old time, were ſeene ſo louinglie entertaining one another by a windeowe, that albeit no offenſiue thinge paſſed betweene them, yet Abimelech well iudged therby, that they could not be other then man and wife. The great Saint Lewes, as rigourous to his owne fleshe, as tender in loue to his wife, was allmoſt blamed for too much kindnes; though in deed he rather deſerued exceeding praiſe, for knowing how to applie his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik and courageous mind, to the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſmall duties, requiſite to the
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:5901:224"/> conſeruation of coniugall loue, for although theſe pettie demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of pure and vnfained affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, bind not the harts of theſe that loue, yet they approache them one to another, and ſerue for a kind of art, to keep mutuall loue in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Saint Monica being with child of great Saint Auguſtin, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated him oftentimes to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion, and to the true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of Gods glorie: as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf witneſſeth, ſaying that <hi>he had already tasted the ſalt of God in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there wombe.</hi> This is a notable leſſon for Chriſtian wemen, to offer vp to God the fruicts of their wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, euen before they be deliuered of them, for God accepteth the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of a louing and humble ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le; and commonly giueth good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to thoſe holie motions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of good mothers at that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me: witneſſe Saint Thomas of Aquin, Saint Andrew of Feſula, and diuers others. The mother of <hi>S.</hi> Bernard (a
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:5901:225"/> worthie mother of ſo worthie a child ſo ſoone as her children were borne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> took them in her armes, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them vp to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt and from thence foorth, she loued them with ſuch reuerence, as holy veſſels committed vnto her by God; which fell out ſo happilie vnto her, that in the end they became Saints all ſeauen.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The children being once borne into the world, and beginning to haue the vſe of reaſon, then ought their parents to haue an eſpeciall care, to emprint the feare and loue of God in their tender harts. The good Queen Blaunche, performed this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice excellentlie well in her ſonne king Lewes the Saint; for she would often times ſay vnto him, <hi>my dear child, I had rather farre thou shouldſt dye before mine eyes, then ſee thee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt one onely mortall ſinne.</hi> Which notable ſaying remained ſo engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the ſoule of her royall child, that, (as he himſelf was woont to tell) not one day in all his life paſt ouer his head, wherin he did not call
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:5901:225"/> it to remembrance, taking all paines poſſible to put this diuine doctrine in practize. Races, and generations in our tongue are called houſes, and the Hebrewes call generation of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the bwilding vp of a houſe; for in that ſence the ſcripture ſayth, that God builded houſes for the midwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of egypt: wherby we learne, that to make a good houſe, is not to fill it with worldlie treaſures, but to bring vp children in the feare of God, and exerciſe of virtues, wherin no paines nor trauaile is to be ſpared, for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are the father and mothers glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. So Saint Monica with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie and perſeuerance, ſtraue againſt the badde inclinations of her ſonn Saint Auguſtin: for hauing folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed him by ſea and by land, she made him more happily, the child of teares by conuerſion of his ſoule, then he had beene the childe of her bloud, by generation of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Saint Paul leaueth to wemen the care of their houshold, as their dutie and office: for which cauſe
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:5901:226"/> manie are of this opinion, that the deuotion of the wife, is much more profitable to her familie, then the virtue of her husband; becauſe he, being not ſo ordinarilie within dores, cannot ſo eaſilie and continuallie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his folk in virtue: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Salomon in his prouerbes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the happines of the whole houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; to depend of the induſtrie and care of that valourous and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous woman, whome there he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribeth.</p>
               <p n="15">15. It is written in Geneſis, that Iſaac ſeeing his wiſe Rebecca barren, prayed to God for her, or according to the Hebrew text, prayed our Lord ouer againſt her; becauſe he prayed on one ſide of their oratorie, and she on the other: and the prayer of her housband made in this manner, was heard. The greateſt and fruictful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt vnion between man and wife, is that which is made in deuotion, to which one should exhort the other moſt earneſtlie. Some fruicts for their ſowerneſſe are not much wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, vnleſſe they be conſerued as quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:5901:226"/> others becauſe of their tendernes cannot be long be kept, vnleſſe they be preſerued, as cherries and aprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks: So wemen should wishe that their husbands were preſerued and comfited with the ſugar of deuotion; without which man is ſower, bittter, and intollerable; And the husbands should procure that their wiues did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in deuotion, becauſe without it the woman is fraile, and ſubiect to fall and wither away in virtue. Saint Paul ſayth: <hi>that the vnbeleeuing man is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the faithfull woman, and the vnbeleeuing woman by the faithfull man:</hi> becauſe in this ſtraight bond of we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlock, the one may eaſilie draw the other to virtue; but what a bleſſing is it, when the faithfull man and wife, do ſanctifie one another in the true feare of God.</p>
               <p n="16">16. To conclude the mutuall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of one another ought to be ſo great, that they should neuer be both at once angrie, or moued on the ſodaine. Bees cannot reſt in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where ecchoes or redoublings
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:5901:227"/> of voices are heard: nor can the holie Ghoſt certainlie remaine in that hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, in which ſtrife, and debate, chiding and ſcolding, and redoubled braulings vſe to be. Saint Gregorie Nazianzen witneſſeth, that in his time married perſons, kept the anniuerſarie day of their matrimonie holie and feſtiuall: and I could wiſhe that good cuſtom were put in practize in theſe dayes, ſo that it were not with worldly and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall demonſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of exteriour myrth, but that the housband and wife confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge and communicatinge that day, should reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend vnto God with more then ordinarie feruour, the conſtant quiet of their marriage, renewing their good purpoſes to ſanctifie their ſtate by mutuall loue and loyaltie, taking breath in our Lord, to ſupport the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the charge of their vocation.</p>

As they that eate for mutuall conuerſation, doe it freelie, and not as it were by force, but rather in outward appeeraunce, at leaſt wiſe giue shew of an appetite to their meate: ſo the mariage debt should alway be payed and performed fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckly, faithfullie, as it were with hope and deſire of children, albeit for ſome occaſion there were no ſubiecte of ſuch hope.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To eate, not for the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reaſons, but only to content the appetite, is tollerable, but not commendable: becauſe the onely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſenſuall appetite, cannot be a ſufficient obiect, to make an
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:5901:228"/> action worthie of commendation: yt is enough that it be tolerable. To eate not only for our appetite, but with exceſſe alſo and diſorderlie, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth blame more, or leſſe, according as the exceſſe is great or litle.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The exceſſe in eating conſiſteth not in the quantitie onely, but in the manner alſo of eatinge. It is ſtraunge (my Philotheus) that honnie being ſo wholſome, and ſo proper a food to the Bees, that yet ſometimes they become ſick by it, as when in the ſpring time they eat to much of it, it ingendreth in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the flux of the bellie, and ſometimes it killes them with out remedie, as when they are behonnied with it about their head and wings. Certainlie the act of marriage, is holie, iuſt, commendable, &amp; profitable to common weale: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in ſome caſe it is daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; for ſometimes it infecteth the foule with veniall ſinne, as it chaunceth by a meere and ſimple exceſſe; and ſometime it killeth the ſoule by mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſinne, as it falleth out, when the naturall order appointed for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of children is peruerted;
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:5901:229"/> in which as one ſwarueth more or leſſe from the order of nature, ſo are the ſinnes more or leſſe execrable, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways mortall. For becauſe procreation of children is the principall end of marriage, one many neuer lawfullie depart from the order which it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, though for ſome accident, it cannot at that time be performed; as it falleth out, when barrenneſſe, or being great which child alreadie, do hinder the generation. For in theſe accidents the act of marriage doth not ceaſe to be holie and iuſt, ſo that the rules of generation be kept: no acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent whatſoeuer being able to preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the law, that the principall end of marriage preſcribeth. The execrable act committed by Onan in his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, was deteſtable before God, as the holie text of the 38. chapter of Geneſis doth teſtifie: although certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne hereticks of our dayes, a hundred times more worthie to be condemned, then the ancient Cynicks (of whome Saint Hierom ſpeaketh vpon the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Hebres) made God to ſay, that it was the peruerſe intention of
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:5901:229"/> that naughtie man which diſpleaſed God: wheras the ſcripture ſayth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and aſſureth vs in particular, that the thinge or act it ſelfe, was abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is a true mark of a ſcadle, gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and beaſtly mind, to thinck ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtlie of meat, before the time of repaſt: much more when after meales one pawſeth and delighteth in the pleaſure he took in eatinge, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it in thought and word, and reuoluing in his mind the remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the ſenſuall delight he receaued in ſwallowing downe his morſells; as they doe, who before dinner haue their minde on the ſpitte, and after dinner in the dishes; men worthie to be the ſkullions of a kitchin, <hi>who make a God of their bellie,</hi> as Saint Paul ſaith. Thoſe which be well and mannerlie brought vp, thinck of the table, but euen when they are readie to ſit downe; and after dinner washe their hands and mouthe, to looſe both ſauour and ſmell of that which they haue eaten. The Elephant is but a groſſe beaſt, yet moſt worthie of all the reſt, and which aboundeth
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:5901:230"/> moſt in ſenſe: I will tell you a point of his honeſtie: he neuer changeth his mate, and loueth her tenderlie whome he hath choſen, with who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me notwithſtanding he coupleth not, but from three yeers to three yeares, and that onelie for fiue dayes, and ſo ſecretlie, that he is neuer ſeene in the act: but the ſixt day he sheweth him ſelf abroad againe, and the firſt thing he doeth, is to goe directlie to ſome riuer and washe his bodie, not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to returne to his troupe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, till he be purified. Be not theſe goodlie and honeſt qualities in a beaſt? by which he teacheth mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried folk not to be giuen to much to ſenſuall and carnall pleaſures, which according to their vocation they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue exerciſed: but the vſe being paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to washe their hart and affection from it, and purge them ſelues of it, that afterward with all libertie, and freedome of mind, they may exerciſe other actions more pure and of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter valew. In this aduiſe conſiſteth the perfect practize of that excellent doctrine of Saint Paul, giuen vnto
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:5901:230"/> the Corinthians: <hi>The time is short</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>it remaineth that they who haue wiues, be as though they had them not.</hi> For according to Saint Gregorie, he hath a wife as though he had her not, who in taking corporall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with her, is not for all that, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and diſturbed from ſpirituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, and what is ſayd of the man, is to be vnderſtood of the woman: that they that <hi>vſe this world</hi> (ſayth the ſame Apoſtle) <hi>be as though they vſed it not.</hi> Let euerie one then vſe this world according to his calling, but yet in ſuch ſort, that he engage not his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction too deeplie therin: but remaine ſtill as free and as readie to ſerue God, as yf they vſed not the world at all. It is great hurt to a man (ſayth Saint Auſtin) to deſire the enioying of thoſe things, which he should onely vſe, and to vſe thoſe things which he should onely enioy: we should enioy ſpirituall things, and onely vſe corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things: for when their vſe is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into enioying, our reaſonable ſoule is conuerted into a ſauage and beaſtlie ſoule. I thinck I haue ſayd all that I

               <head>Inſtructions for widdowes. CHAPTER 39.</head>
               <p>SAINT Paule inſtructeth all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats in the perſon of his deere ſcholer Timothie, ſaying: <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thoſe widowes which are widowes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi> To be a widowe indeed, theſe things are required.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That not onely she be a widow in bodie, but in hart alſo; that she be reſolued with an inuiolable purpoſe, to keep her ſelf in the eſtate of chaſt widowhood. For thoſe which are wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes but onely while they expect mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, are not ſeparated from huſbands but onely in reſpect of bodily pleaſure, for they be alreadie ioined to them in hart and will. But yf the true widow, to confirme her ſelfe in the ſtate of wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood, will offer vnto God her bodie, and chaſtitie by vowe, she shall adde a great ornament to her widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:5901:231"/> and make her reſolution ſecure. for ſince that after her vow she is no more in her owne power, and cannot leaue her chaſtitie without forgoing her part in paradiſe; she wilbe more zealous of her deſignement, and ſuffer not ſo much as one litle thought of marriage to ſtay in her hart, no not the ſpace of one onely moment: So that this ſacred vowe, will put a ſtrong bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warck between her ſoule, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of thoughts, that are contrarie to her holy reſolution. Saint Auſtin coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelleth this vow verie earneſtlie to a Chriſtian widow, and the ancient and learned Origen goeth much farther: for he exhorteth maried wemen to propoſe and vow chaſtitie of widowhood, in caſe their housbands should die before them: that among the ſenſuall pleaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res which they may haue in their wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock; they may enioy the merit of chaſt widowhood, by this promiſe and vow made before hand. The vow maketh the work more acceptable vnto God, fortifieth the will to do it more coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly, and giueth to God, not onely the good works, which are the fruicts
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:5901:232"/> of our will, but dedicateth likewiſe vnto him our will it ſelf, as the root and tree of all our actions. By ſimple chaſtitie we lend our bodie to God, retaining notwithſtanding our libertie, to ſubiect it when we liſt to ſenſuall pleaſure: but by the vowe of chaſtitie we make him an abſolute and irreuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable preſent of our bodie, without reſeruing to our ſelf anie poſſibilitie to goe back from our word; rendring our ſelues happie ſlaues vnto him, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe bondage is better then all royalties. As I approue the aduiſe of theſe two great perſonages, ſo could I wishe, that thoſe ſoules which are ſo happie, as to folow them, would doe it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, holily and ſoundlie, hauing well examined their forces, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked the grace of God, and taking the counſell of ſome wiſe and deuout directour: for ſo all will proſper the better.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Beſides it is neceſſarie that the abrenunciation of ſecond marriage, be made purely and ſimplie, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert all our affections vnto God more loyallie, and to make our hart cleaue
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:5901:232"/> vnto Gods hart on euery ſide: for yf the deſire to leaue her children rich, or any other worldly reſpect, do keep the widow in widowhood, she may deſerue praiſe and commendation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, but not before God: ſince in Gods ſight nothing is trulie praiſewor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, but that which is done for honour and reuerence of his diuine maieſtie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Likewiſe a true widow muſt be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarilie abſtracted from all prophane contentments: for <hi>the widowe which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth deliciouſly,</hi> ſayth <hi>S.</hi> Paule, <hi>is dead in her life time.</hi> She that wilbe a widowe, &amp; yet delights to be courted, embraced, made much of, and takes pleaſure in dauncing, and feaſting, deſiring perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, tricking and trimming her ſelf, is a widow aliue in bodie, but dead in ſoule. What auaileth it whether the image of Adonis, or prophane loue, which han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth for a ſigne before the dore of fleshly delight, be painted with good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie flowers and plumes round about it, or the face thereof be couered with a nett, or a cypres? For ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe not without much vanitie ſome times, black morning apparell ſerues,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:5901:233"/> to make her beautie more apparent: the widdow hauing made triall of that wherin women do pleaſe men moſt, caſteth more dangerous baites into their minds. The widow then which liueth in theſe fond delights, is dead being aliue, and is nothing els, to ſpeak properlie, but an idoll of widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The time of pruning is at hand, the voice of the turtle doue hath been heard in our land,</hi> ſaith the holie Ghoſt in the Canticles. All men that will liue deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlie, muſt prune and shaue away all worldly ſuperfluities: but eſpeciallie is this needfull to true widowes, who like Turtle doues, come freshelie from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing &amp; lamenting the loſſe of their deer husbands. When Noemy returned from Moab to Bethlehem, the wemen of the towne, who had knowne her when she was firſt married, ſayd one to another, is not this Noemy? but she anſwered: call me not Noemy, I pray you (for Noemy ſignifieth comely and wel-fauoured) but call me Mara, for our Lord hath filled my ſoule with bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; which she ſayd becauſe her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:5901:233"/> was dead. Euen ſo the deuout wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe will neuer be termed or eſteemed faire and beautifull, contenting her ſelf to be ſuch as it pleaſeth God she be.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Lampes that are fedwith ſweet oyle, caſt a ſweeter ſmell when they are blowne out: and widowes, whoſe liues were pure and laudable during their wedlock, powre out a ſweeter odour and virtue of chaſtirie, when theire light (that is their husbands) is put out and extinguished by death. To loue their husbands being aliue is an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thing amongſt wemen: but to loue them ſo well, as to take no other after their death and departure, is a loue which pertaineth onely to true wido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes. To hope in God, ſo long as the husband is a liue, and ſetueth for a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to ſupport his wife, is not a thing ſo rare to be ſeene: but to hope in God when she is deſtitute of ſo great a prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe and ſtay of her life, is indeed worthie of commendations. This is the reaſon that one may with greater facilitie know in widowhood the perfection of virtues, then one could haue done in the ſtate of marriage.</p>
               <pb n="482" facs="tcp:5901:234"/>
               <p n="6">6. The widow that hath children which ſtand in need of her aſſiſtance &amp; bringing vp, principallie in matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to their ſoules health, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of their courſe of life; cannot, nor ought in anie wiſe abandon them: for the Apoſtle <hi>S.</hi> Paule ſayth clearlie, that they are obliged to take that care of them, which they them ſelues had before experienced in their fathers and mothers: and that yf anie haue not care of his owne familie, he is worſe then an infidel. But yf her children be in ſtate, that they ſtand no more in need of her guiding, then should she gather to gea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all her thoughts, and imploy them whollie to enrich her hart with the pure and holie loue of God.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Yf meere conſtraint bind not the conſcience of the widow to outward, affaires, as proceſſes, and ſuch like, I counſel her to auoide them altogether, and to to vſe that order in menaging her affaires, which is moſt peaceable, and recollected, although it ſeeme not ſo gainfull. For the profits gotten by contentions and troubleſome labour, muſt be verie great indeed, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:5901:234"/> the benefit of a quiet life: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that wrangling pleas and proceſſe do diſtract the hart, and oft times open a gate to the enemies of chaſtitie: while to pleaſe them, whoſe fauour they need, they are faine manie times to vſe demeanure and behaueour diſpleaſing to God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Prayer muſt be the widowes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall exerciſe: for she muſt now loue nothing but God: she muſt vſe almoſt no words but for Gods ſake. And as the iron which by the preſence of the Diamant was hindered from fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Loadſtone, leapes after it ſo ſoone as the Diamant is remoued away: ſo the chaſt widowes hart which could not eaſilie giue it ſelf whollie to folowe Gods holie inſpirations, during the life of her husband, should imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after his death, runne with ardent affection after the ſweet odours, and celeſtiall perfumes of her Lord, ſaying with the ſacred ſpouſe, O Lord, now that I am all mine owne, receaue me altogether, <hi>drawe me after thee, and I will runne after the ſweet ſmell of thy ointments.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="484" facs="tcp:5901:235"/>
               <p n="9">9. Virtues peculiar to Chriſtian wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes are, perfect modeſtie, neglect of honors, ranckes, places, titles, and ſuch like vanities; to ſerue the poore, viſit the ſick, comfort the afflicted, inſtruct young maydens, and encline them to affect pietie and deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and in a word to yeald them ſelues a perfect patterne all virtues: to the younger woemen, cleanlines, and honeſt ſimplicitie, muſt be the two ornaments of theire habits, humilite and charitie, muſt adorne theire actions, honeſtie and curteſie, muſt grace theire ſpeech, modeſtie and shamfaſtnes, muſt beautifie theire eies, and Chriſt Ieſus crucified, muſt be the only loue of theire harts. In ſumme, the true widdowe, is in the Catholique Church, as it were a freſh ſweete violet in the month of March, which ſendes abroad from the flagrant odor of hir deuotion, an incomparable ſuauitie, and yet almoſt couers &amp; hides hir ſelfe, with the great leaues of her humilitie and voluntarie abiection, betokning by her dark pale colour, her exerciſes of mortification: she is vſually found in freſh coole places, and vnmanured
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:5901:235"/> plots of ground, and will not be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with the hott noyſome ayre of the worldes conuerſation, the better to conſerue the pleaſaunt freshnes of her ſoule, againſt all inordinat heates, which the deſire of riches, of honor, and dangerous loues, might breede in her hart. <hi>She shall be bleſſed,</hi> ſaith the holy Apoſtle, <hi>if she perſeuer in this ſort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. I haue many other thinges to ſay of this matter, but I haue ſaid enough, and all, when I ſaid, that the widdow zealous of the honor of her eſtate, reade attentiuely the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Epiſtles, which great Saint Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom wrote to Furia, Saluia, and all thoſe other Dames, which were ſo happie, as to be the ghoſtlie children of that holy Father; for nothing can be added vnto that which he ſayeth, but only this admonition; that a true widdow, should neuer blame thoſe that marrie the ſecond time, nay though they marrie, the third, and fourth time; for in ſome caſes, God almightie ſo diſpoſeth it for his greater glorie. One muſt alwayes haue his
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:5901:236"/> eies vpon this doctrin of our holie forefathers, that nether widdowhood, nor virginitie, haue any other place in heauen, but that which true humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie doth allot and aſſigne them.</p>

               <head>The nature of tentations, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between feeling them, and conſenting to them. CHAPTER 3.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IMAGIN a young princeſſe (my Philotheus) greatly beloued of her husband: and that ſome trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous vilaine to winne her, and defile her marriage bed, ſendeth to her ſome infamous pandar, with a loue-meſſage, to treat with her about his diſloyall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, firſt this noughtie pandar, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth vnto the princeſſe, the intent of his maiſter: ſecondly the princes taketh the embaſſage in good, or euil part: thirdly she either conſenteth, or refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. Euen ſo the diuel, the world, and the flesh, perceauing the ſoule of man eſpouſed to the Sonne of God, do ſend their temptations and ſuggeſtions vnto her, by the which firſt, ſinne is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto her: ſecondly, she either is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, or diſpleaſed with the ſinfull motion: and thirdly, she either admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:5901:243"/> it by conſent, or reiecteth and caſteth it away from her: which are in ſumme, the three ſteppes or ſtaires by which we deſcend to wickednes, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, or temptation, delight, and conſent. And though theſe three acts, are not ſo manifeſtly knowne and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in other kinds of ſinnes, yet are they palpablie ſeene, in all greate and enormous ſinnes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though the tentation of any ſinne that is, should endure all our life long, it would not make vs vngratefull to his diuine maieſtie, ſo that it pleaſe vs not, ſo that we take no delight in it, nor giue any conſent vnto it. And the reaſon is, becauſe in the tentation there paſſeth no morall action of ours, but we only ſuffer it: and ſo taking no pleaſure in it, we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be in no fault for it. <hi>S.</hi> Paule a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time ſuffered the tentations of the flesh, and yet was ſo far from diſpleaſing God therefore, that contrarie wiſe God eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him ſelf glorified thereby. The B. <hi>S.</hi> Angela de Fulgino, felt ſuch veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t tentations of the flesh, that she moueth to compaſſion when she recounteth them; great likewiſe were the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:5901:243"/> which <hi>S.</hi> Francis, and <hi>S.</hi> Benet ſuffered, when the one caſt him ſelfe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked into the thornes, and the other into the ſnow, to mitigate them: yet loſt they not for all that, any whit of the grace of God, but rather augmented it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thou muſt be valiaunt then and courageous (my Philotheus, (amid ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and neuer hold thy ſelf for van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished, ſo long as thou findeſt that the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tation diſpleaſeth thee Obſerue well the difference, between hauing, and conſenting to tentation; which is, that we may haue, or feele them, though they vtterly diſlike and diſpleaſe vs; but we can neuer conſent vnto them, vnleſſe they pleaſe vs, ſince pleaſure ordinarilie ſerueth as a ſteppe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Let then the enemies of our ſaluation, preſent vnto vs as many bittes and baites as euer they will; let them alway ſtand watching at the dore of our hart to get in; let them make vs as many offers, and proffers, as they liſt: but yet ſo long as we haue a true purpoſe and ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g reſolution, to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke no manner of pleaſure in them, it is not poſſible that we shoulde
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:5901:244"/> offend God, no more then the Prince, husband to the princeſſe before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, can beare her any ill will or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, for the noughtie meſſage ſent vnto her, yf she haue taken no delight or pleaſure in it. Yet ther is a difference between the ſoule and this princeſſe, that the princeſſe hauing once vnderſtood this dishoneſt errand, may yf she liſt, driue away the meſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger and heare him no more: which is not alwayes in the power of the ſoule, for she ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not chooſe but feel the tentation, though it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in her power not to conſent to it; for which cauſe, although the tentation should perſeuer neuer ſo long time, yet can it not hurt or defile vs, ſo long as it diſliketh and diſpleaſeth vs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But as for the delight which may folow the temptation, becauſe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re are two parts or portions of our ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, the one inferiour, and the other ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour; and the inferiour or ſenſualitie foloweth not always the ſuperiour, or reaſonable portion, but keeps houſe apart (as it were:) it falleth out oft times that the inferiour part taketh delight in the tentation whout the conſent; nay
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:5901:244"/> againſt the will of the ſuperiour. This is the quarrel, and battaile which the Apoſtle <hi>S.</hi> Paule deſcribeth, when he ſayeth, that his flesh rebelled againſt his ſpirit, that there is one law of the members, or bodie, and another of the ſpirit, and ſuch other things.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Haſt thou not ſeene (Philotheus) a great burning firebrand, couered with ashes and imbers? when one cometh ten or twelue houres after to ſeek for fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, he finds but a litle in the middeſt of the hearth, and ſome times hath much a doe to find any. Yet there was fire there all the while, for other wiſe he could now haue found none at all: and with that litle that he found, he may kindle all the other dead coales and bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d-ends; The ſelf ſame paſſeth in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, (which is the ſpirituall fire of our ſoule) amid many great and violent ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. For tentation darting her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light into the lower portion, couereth all the ſoule (as it ſeemeth) with ashes, and bringeth the loue of God to ſuch a ſtraight, as yf it had rome onely (as men ſay) to ſtand a tiptoe: for it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not at all any where, ſauing only
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:5901:245"/> in the middeſt of the hart, in the very bottom and center of the ſpirit; and yet ſeemeth ſcarce to be there, and we haue much a doe to find and perceaue it. Notwithſtanding without all doubt it remaines there, ſince how ſo euer we fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le our ſelues troubled in ſoule &amp; bodie, yet we find in our hart, a ſetled reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to conſent to ſinne, not tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the delight which pleaſeth our outward man, or ſenſualitie, diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and diſliketh the inward, or reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable will, ſo that though it be round about it, like the cenders about the coale, yet is it not within it; wherby we may plainly ſee, that ſuch delight is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary, and altogether contrary, to our will, and can therfore be no ſinne at all.</p>

               <head>How tentation and delectation may be ſinne. CHAPTER 6.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THE princeſſe of whome we ſpake right now, could not hinder the dishoneſt demaund made vnto her, becauſe, as we preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it came to her vnawares, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her will: but yf on the other ſide, she should by ſome wanton glaunces giue occaſion to be requeſted, by tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſecret or careleſſe tokens, declaring her ſelf not vnwilling, of rendring loue to him that should court her: then doubtleſſe were she culpable of the meſſage it ſelfe: and though she shew her ſelf neuer ſo quaint and coy, she should for all that, deſerue blame and punishment. So chaunceth it many ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, that the very tentation it ſelf is a ſinne in vs, becauſe we our ſelues wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly are the cauſe of it, for example. I know that in gaming I fall eaſilie to rage &amp; blaſphemie, &amp; that gaming is to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:5901:249"/> me, as it were a tentation to thoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: I ſinne therfore as often, and as many times as I play at that game, and am guiltie of the tentation which then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce ariſeth. Againe, yf I know certainly that ſuch a conuerſation, is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie a cauſe of tentation and fall vnto me, and yet notwithſtanding do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly go to it, I am acceſſarie to al the tentations which doe enſew from thence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the delight which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the tentation maye be auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it is always ſinne to receaue it: according as the pleaſure which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, and as the conſent which we gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue vnto it, is great or litle, long or short in durance: So it is always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible in the young princeſſe of whom we ſpake, yf she do not onely harken vnto the laſciuious and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt demaund, which is made vnto her: but withal, after that she hath heard it, taketh pleaſure in it, entertaining her thought with ſome delight about this obiect. For although she will not conſent to the real execution of the diſloyaltie motioned to her: she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:5901:250"/> not withſtanding to the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall appliyng of her hart, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment which she taketh in the naughtie ſuggeſtion; And it is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a dishoneſt acte, to applie ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind or bodie, vnto any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt obiect: nay dishoneſtie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in ſuch ſort in the application of the mind, that without it, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliyng of the bodie, were no ſinne at all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. So then, when thou shalt be tempted in any ſinne, conſider whether thou haſt willingly giuen occaſion to be ſo tempted: for then the verie tentation it ſelfe, putteth thee in ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of ſinne, by reaſon of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard wherin thou haſt wittingly caſt thy ſelf, which is to be vnderſtood, when thou mighteſt commodiouſlie haue auoided the occaſion; and that thou didſt foreſee, or wert bound to forſee, that in ſuch an occaſion, ſuch a temptation would ariſe. But yf thou haſt giuen no occaſion at all to the tentation which impugneth thee: it cannot in any ſort be imputed vnto thee for a ſinne.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:5901:250"/>
               <p n="4">4. When the delight folowing the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation might baue been shunned, &amp; yet we eſchew it not, there is allwaye ſome kind of ſinne, according to the litle or long continuance in it, and according to the cauſe of delight take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in it. A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath giuen no occaſion to be courted, but yet taketh pleaſure ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, letteth not to be blameworthie, though the pleaſure which she affected, haue no other cauſe or motiue, but only the courting. For example, yf her gallant play excellent wel on the lute, and she delighteth, not in that he ſeeketh her loue, but in the harmonie &amp; ſweetnes of his lute; there is no ſinne in that delight: yet muſt she not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new long in it, leaſt she eaſilie paſſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, to delight in being wooed. So yf any bodie prepou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to me ſome ſtratageme ful of inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion &amp; cunning, to make me compaſſe a full reuenge vpon mine enemie: yf I take no delight, nor giue any conſent to the deſire or purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of reuenge which is motioned vnto me, but only in the ſlight and ſubtil art of the engin, or inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without doubt I ſinne not at all:

               <p n="5">5. We find our ſelues ſometimes ouertaken and ſurprized with ſome tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling of delight, immediatly after the tentation is preſented vnto vs, before we haue well conſidered the qualitie and danger therof: and this delight is but a ſmall veniall ſinne, though it wax greater and greater, yf after we percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the danger we are in, we ſtay, negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently dalliyng, and as it were coping and cheapning with the delight, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we should admitt it, or reiect it; and yet more, yf we negligently ſtay in it, after we perceaue the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, without any purpoſe at all litle or great to caſt it away out of our hart: but when as voluntarilie, and of full purpoſe we reſolue to take content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that delight, that deliberat pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is a great ſinne, yf the obiect of the delight be verie naught.

               <p n="1">1. CONSIDER from time to time what paſſions do raigne in thy ſoule, and hauing diſcouered them, begin a manner and courſe of life cleane oppoſite and contrarie vnto them in thought, word, and deed. For example, yf thou find thy ſelf inclined to the paſſion of ſelf loue and vainglorie: thinck often vpon the miſerie of this mortall life of ours; how bitter theſe vanities wilbe to our conſcience at the howre of our death; how vncomly they be for a noble and generous hart; that they are but trifles, and babies for litle children to play withall, and ſuch other conſiderations as theſe. Speak alſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and often againſt vainglorie, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ſeeme thou ſpeakeſt againſt thy will, diſpraiſe it to the vttermoſt of thy power: for ſo thou shalt in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:5901:256"/> engage thy owne reputation to flie from that in deed, which thou ſo much condemneſt in words: and many times by much ſpeaking againſt a thing, we moue our ſelues to hate and deſpiſe it, though at the firſt we bare it affection. Exerciſe works of humilitie and abie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as much as thou canſt, euen againſt thy owne inclination, for ſo thou shalt quickly get a habit of humilitie, and weaken the vice of vainglorie in ſuch ſort, that when the temptation aſſaileth thee, thy inclination wilbe now no more able to take part with the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and thy ſoule will haue more ſtrength to reſiſt it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yf thou art inclined to couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, thinck often vpon the extreme follie, and madnes of this vice, which rendreth vs ſlaues to that droſſe which was created to ſerue vs; thinck how at our death we muſt leaue all, and that perhaps in the hands of them, that will ſcatter it as careleſſely, as we had carefully ſcraped it together; and perchaunce in their hands, to whome it wilbe cauſe of their vtter ruine and damnation. Speak much againſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:5901:257"/> auarice, and praiſe the contempt of worldlie pelfe. Enforce thy ſelf often times to giue almes, and to put in vre the acts of charitie, and works of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and accuſtome ſome times to omitt ſome occaſions of gaine and commoditie.</p>

               <head>Of vnquietnes of mind. CHAPTER 11.</head>
               <p n="1">1. VNQVIETNES is not a ſimple and ſingle temptation, but a ſource and ſpring from when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce many other temptations take their beginning: I will ſpeak a word or two therof. Sadnes is nothing els but a grief and ſorow of mind, conceiued for ſome ill or damage, which is in vs againſt our will: whether this euil be outward, as pouertie, ſicknes, contempt: or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as ignorance, lack of deuotion, repugnance, temptation. For when the ſoule feeleth her ſelf charged and burdened with any euil, she is aggree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued therat, and there enters ſadnes into her: and preſently she deſireth to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered and freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it: and not with out
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:5901:258"/> good reaſon: for euery thing naturally deſireth that which is good, and flieth from that which is knowen or ſuppoſed to be euil. Yf the ſoule ſeek out meanes to be freed from the euil which oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth her, and to be rid from the burden of it for Gods loue, she will ſeek thoſe meanes with patience, ſweetnes, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and repoſe of mind, expecting her deliuery more from the prouidence and goodnes of God, then from her owne induſtrie, labour, and diligence. But yf she deſire to be eaſed from her vexation for ſelf loue, then will she torment and weerie, and trouble her ſelf in ſeeking the meanes of her eaſe: as though it depended more of her ſelf, then of God. I ſay not that she thincketh or iudgeth ſo, but that she behaueth her ſelf ſo carefullie, ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelie, &amp; ſo earneſtlie, as yf indeed she thought ſo. So that yf she meet not with that which she deſireth, preſentlie and out of hand, then falleth she into great vnquietnes, and impatience; by which the former vexation or euil, not departing from her, but rather waxing farre worſe, she entreth into
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:5901:258"/> anguish, diſtreſſe, faintnes of hart, and loſſe of all courage: ſo that she iudgeth and deemeth her miſerie to be paſt all remedie. Where thou ſeeſt, that ſadnes, which had a iuſt and lawfull beginning grounded vpon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable conſiderations, afterward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth vnquietnes, and vnquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againe, addeth an increaſe of ſadnes, which is exceeding peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This vnquietnes of mind, is the greateſt ill that can come to the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, excepting ſinne. For as the ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ciuil diſcords of a common wealth, is the vtter ruine and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw therof, and maketh it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnable to reſiſt the forraigne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uader: ſo our hart troubled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted in it ſelf, looſeth all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and abilitie, to defend the virtues which it had purchaſed, and all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to reſiſt the tentations of the ghoſtlie enemie; who at that time vſeth all kind of diuices and inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, knowing that according to the prouerbe it is, good fishing in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled water.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:5901:259"/>
               <p n="3">3. Vnquietnes proceedeth of a inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate deſire to be deliuered from the euil that one feeleth, or to obtaine the good that one deſireth: and yet nothing maketh the euil worſe, nor remoueth the good farther from vs, then doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnes and vnreaſonable haſtines. Birds do remaine faſt in the nets and lime-twigges, becauſe finding them ſelues but a litle caught hold of, they beat and flutter vp and downe ſo eagre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they are more and more entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in the ſnare. When thou deſireſt earneſtly to be freed from any euil, or to obtaine any good; the firſt thing thou muſt doe, is to repoſe thy mind, and quiet thy thoughts and affects from ouer-haſtie pourſuite of thy deſire: and then faire and ſoftly beginne to pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe thy wishe, taking by order, and one after another, the meanes which thou iudgeſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient to the attaining therof. And when I ſay faire and ſoftly, I doe not meane ſlowly and neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, but without poſt-haſt, without trouble and vnquietnes: otherwiſe inſteed of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the effect of thy deſire, thou wilt be more entangled in this laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:5901:259"/> of troublſom thoughts, then before.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>My ſoule is allway in my hands ô Lord: and I haue not forgotten thy law;</hi> ſayd Dauid. Examin often euery day, at leaſt morning &amp; euening, whether thy ſoule be in thy hands, or ſome paſſion of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnes hath robbed thee of it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether thou haue thy hart at commandement, whether it be not eſcaped and fled away from thee, to ſome vnrulie affection of loue, hatred, enuie, couetouſnes, feare, ioye, ſadnes: and yf it be wandred aſtray, ſeek it out preſently, and bring it back again gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlie to the preſence of God, reſigning it with all thy affections and deſires vnto the obedience and direction of his diuine pleaſure. For as they that feare leaſt they loſe a thing which they loue well, keep it faſt claſped in their hands: ſo in imitation of this great king we should always ſay from our harts: O my God my ſoule is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall danger of being loſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I carie it always in my hand, and for this diligent care of my ſoule, I haue not forgotten thy holie lawe.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:5901:260"/>
               <p n="5">5. Permitt not thy deſires, be they neuer ſo litle, and of neuer ſo ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, to diſquiet thy mind: for after litle deſires, come great ones, and find thy hart more readie and diſpoſed to be troubled and put out of order. When thou perceaueſt vnquietnes to enter, commend thy ſelf to God, and reſolue thy ſelf to doe nothing at all, that thy vehement deſire exhorteth, vntill that diſquiet be ouerpaſſed: vnleſſe it be ſome thing that cannot be differred: and then thou muſt with a gentle an quiet endeuour, withhold the current of thy affection, tempering and moderating it as much as is poſſible: and after this repoſe, doe that which is requiſite to be done, not as thy deſire commandeth, but as reaſon preſcribeth.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If thou ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt diſcouer the vnquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of thy mind to him that gouerneth thy ſoule, or at the leaſt to ſome truſtie and deuout frind: doubt not but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently thou shalt find it appeaſed. For communicating of griefs of our hart, worketh the ſame effect in the troubled ſoule, that letting of bloud doth in the bodie of him that is in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall ague:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:5901:260"/> and this is the remedie of remedies. So holy king Lewis gaue this councell to his ſonne: If thou feeleſt in thy hart any thing that troubleth thee, tell it preſently vnto thy confeſſour, or vnto ſome good frind, and thou shalt beare thy greef verie eaſily, through the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that he will giue thee.</p>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:5901:266"/> them remaine contented and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied therwith: that ſo they should ſearch no farther for true and ſound deuotion, which conſiſteth in a prompt, reſolute, actiue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant will, of putting in execution that which they know to be agreable to Gods pleaſure. A litle child will weepe tenderly yf he ſee his mother launced when she is let bloud: but yf his mother at the ſame time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand an apple, or a paper of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which he hath in his hands, he will by no meanes let it goe from him, demand it shee neuer ſo ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly. Such for the more part are theſe tender deuotions, conſidering the ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke of the ſpeare, which pearced the hart of our Saueour, we weepe bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie therfore: And alas (my Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus) it is right well donne to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile the ſorowfull death and wofull paſſion of our father and redeemer, but why then do we not giue him the apple which we haue in our hands, ſeeing he asketh it vs ſo earneſtly, to wit, our hart, the only fruict of loue, which our deare Saueour requeſteth
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:5901:266"/> of vs? Wherfore reſigne we not vnto him ſo manie pettie affections, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, &amp; ſelf, pleaſures, which he would pull out of our hands and cannot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be our babies, they be our comfits of which we be more fond, then deſirous of his heauenly grace? Ah Philotheus, theſe be babie-loues, litle childrens frindships, tender indeed, but feeble, but fantaſticall, but frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctleſſe, and without effect. Deuotion then, conſiſteth not in ſuch tender and ſenſible affections, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proceed of a nature or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion in it ſelf ſoft, ſupple, apte and eaſie to receaue any impreſſion: but ſometimes of the crafte of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, who to buſie vs vnprofitablie about ſuch trash and droguerie, ſtirreth vp our fantaſie to the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion fit for to receaue ſuch motions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Yet theſe ſelf ſame tendre and ſweet affections are manie times good and profitable, for they prouoke the appetite of the ſoule, comfort the ſpirit, and adde to the promptitude of our deuotion, a kind of iollitie and cheerfullnes, which maketh our
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:5901:267"/> actions comelie &amp; delightfull, euen in outward shew &amp; appeerance. Which is the guſt or taſt that one feeleth in diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and heauenly matters, of which Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid exclaimeth: <hi>O Lor how ſweet are thy words to my taſt? they are ſweeter then honny to my mouth.</hi> And indeed the leaſt and meaneſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment of deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which we receaue in holy exerciſes, is better in all reſpects, then the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent recreations and pleaſures of the world. The breaſts, and milke, that is, the fauours of the heauenly ſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, are ſweeter and pleaſaunter to the ſoule, then the daintieſt and moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious wine of earthly delights. He that once hath taſted them, eſteemeth all other comforts, but gaulle and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mewood. As they that hold the hearbe Scitique in their mouth, taſt ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt a ſweetnes, that they feele nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hunger nor thirſt for the while: ſo they, to whome God hath imparted this celeſtiall Manna of internall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations, can neither deſire nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the contentments of the world, at leaſt to take any pleaſure in them, or to ſette their affections vpon them.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:5901:267"/> They be taſts giuen before hand, of the immortall delights which God hath layd vp in heauen for the ſoules that ſearche after him: they be the ſugred comfits and carowayes which he giueth vnto vs as his litle children to allure vs: they be the cordiall waters which he preſenteth to ſtrengthen them; and manie times they be handſels, or pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of euerlaſting felicitie. They ſay that Alexander the great, ſailing in the manie ſea, diſcouered before the reſt of his companions, the land of the happie Arabia, by the ſmell of the ſweet odours which the wind brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght with it, and therevpon receaued him ſelfe, and gaue great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to his felow-ſoldiours: ſo oft times in this mortall life, we receaue theſe delights and pleaſures of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which no doubt preſent vnto our memorie, the ioyes and delights of the happie land of heauen, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we doe all ſaile and aſpire.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But thou wilt ſay, ſince there are ſome ſenſible conſolations that be good, and come from God, and other ſome that be vnprofitable, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:5901:268"/> pernicious, proceeding either from nature, or from the enemie, how shall I diſtinguishe the one from the other, and diſcerne the vnprofitable from thoſe that be good. It is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rule (my Philotheus) for all the paſſions and affections of our ſoule, that we muſt know them by their fruicts: our ſoules be as it were trees; affections and paſſions be the bowes and braunches; works and actions be the fruicts. It is a good ſoule, that feeleth good affections, and the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are good which bring foorth in vs great effects of holie actions. Yf the delights, the tendernes, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations which we feele in ſpirituall exerciſes, do make vs more humble, more patient, tractable, charitable, fuller of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; more feruent in mortifying our concupiſcence and naughtie inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; more conſtant in our good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes and reſolutions, more meek and ſupple, and pliable to thoſe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me we ought to obey; more ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ſincere in our liues: then without all doubt Philotheus, they
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:5901:268"/> are from God. But yf theſe delights haue no ſweetnes, ſauing onely for our owne ſelues, yf they make vs curious, peeuish, ſower, ſullen, impatient, ſtubborne, fierce, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, hard harted towards our neighbours, yf therefore eſteeming our ſelues allredie pettie Saints, we will no more be ſubiect to corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction nor direction, then deere Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus, beware of them, then doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleſſe they be falſe and pernicious conſolations. A good tree cannot bring foorth any other but good fruicts.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When we receaue theſe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghts and comforts in our exerciſes we muſt. 1. Firſt of all humble our ſelues profoundly before allmightie God: and take heed of ſaying to our ſelues by reaſon of theſe ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts: how perfect, how good am I become! No Philotheus, not ſo, theſe be good things in deed, but they make vs neuer the better for hauing them: for, as I haue ſayd, deuotion conſiſteth not in them, but let vs ſaye and thinck from our harts: O how good is God
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:5901:269"/> to ſuch as hope in him, to the ſoule that ſeeketh after him! He that hath ſugar melting in his mouth, cannot properlie ſay that his mouth is ſweet, but that the ſugar, which is in his mouth, is ſweet to his mouth: So though theſe ſpirituall delights be verie good, and that God who impatteth them to vs, is exceeding good, yet folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth it not, that he which receaueth them, is good. 2. Let vs acknowledge our ſelues as yet to be litle children, and that we ſtand in need of milk: that theſe ſugred confits be giuen vs, becauſe as yet our ſpirit is tender and delicate, and therfore needeth allurements and bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, to be drawen with all to the loue of God. 3. But after that, ſpeaking ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallie, and ordinarily, let vs receaue theſe graces and fauours humbly, and reuerently, eſteeming them exceeding pretious, not ſo much for that they are in them ſelues, as that it is the hand of God whiche powreth them into our hart. As a louing mother to allure her child, putteth her owne ſelf the ſugred confits into his mouth one by one, ſweetly ſmiling, and tenderlie parliyng
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:5901:269"/> with him the while: for yf the child had witt and vſe of his reaſon, he would much more eſteeme, his mothers che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing embraces, then the ſweetnes of the confits, be they neuer ſo daintie. So it is much Philotheus to receaue &amp; feel in our ſoules this ſweetnes of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but it is the ſweet of all ſweetnes to conſider that God, with his louing and fatherlie hand, putteth them as it were into our mouth, to our hart, and ſoule. 4. Hauing receiued them thus in humble and reuerent wiſe, let vs em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them whollie according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the giuer. And wherfore think yee, dooth God beſtowe theſe ſweet comforts vpon vs? to make vs ſweet towards euery bodie, and amou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous towards him. The mother giues comfits to her litle child, to make him kiſſe her: let vs likewiſe kiſſe our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saueour, who maketh much of vs by theſe conſolations: to kiſſe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueour, is to obey him, to fullfill his will, to folow his rules and councells: in a word, to embrace him tenderlie &amp; louinglie with obedience and loyaltie. The day therfore in which we shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:5901:270"/> any ſpirituall conſolation, we muſt employ moſt carefullie, and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to ſpend it diligently in Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and honour. 5. Beyond all this, we muſt from time to time renounce in our hart all this ſweetnes, tendernes, and conſolation, ſeparating our affection from it as much as we can: proteſting, that albeit we receaue theſe fauours humblie, and loue and eſteeme them, becauſe God ſendeth them to vs, as it were dishes and dainties from his owne table, to prouoke vs the more to his loue: yet it is not thoſe delights that we ſeek and deſire, but God him ſelf and his perfect loue, not the comforts but the comforter; not the ſweetnes, but the ſweet Saueour that giues them; not that tendernes of delight, but him that is the delight of heauen and earth. And in this affectuous abrenunciation of theſe delights, we muſt diſpoſe our ſelues, to perſeuer conſtant and firme in the holy loue of God, though in all our life long we should not taſt one dramme of conſolation: and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re vnfainedly, to ſay as well vpon the mount of Caluary, as on the mount of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:5901:270"/> Tabor, <hi>O Lord it is good for me to be with thee,</hi> be thou in torments vpon thy croſſe, or be thou in glorie in heauen. 6. To conclude I aduertize thee that yf thou shouldſt chaunce to feele any extraordinarie abounda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations, tendernes, ſweetnes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout teares, or ſome vnwoonted thing: that then thou conferre it faithfullie with thy ſpirituall conductour, that be may teache thee how to moderate and behaue thy ſelf therin. For it is written. <hi>Hast thou found honny? eate of it but as much as is ſufficient.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. THVS then muſt thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue thy ſelf, as I haue now deſcribed in time of ſpirituall comfort: but alas (Philotheus,) this faire weather will not laſt allwayes: and the time will come, when thou shalt be ſo deſtitute, and depriued
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:5901:271"/> of all feeling of this deuotion, that thy ſoule will ſeeme vnto thee a fruictleſſe and barren field, or a deſart wilderneſſe, in which there appeers neither cawſee, nor pathway to find God, nor anie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we of grace to moiſten and water it, through exceſſiue drienes, which thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atneth to reduce her altogether to duſt. Alas the poor ſoule in this caſe deſerues compaſſion, and eſpecially when this deſolation is vehement: for at that time like holy Dauid, she feedeth her ſelf with ſad teares night and day: meane while the enemie by a thouſand ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions endeuours to driue her to deſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, and mocketh her bitterly, ſaying in deriſion, wretche, wher is thy God now in thy diſtreſſe? by what meanes wilt thou find him out? Who shall euer be able to reſtore thee the ioye of his grace?</p>
               <p n="2">2. And what wilt thou doe at that time Philotheus, conſider from what cauſe ſo great a miſerie proceedeth: for oft times, we our ſelues are the cauſe of our owne driennes and deſolation, in the exerciſes of the ſpirit. 1. As a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mother denies to giue ſugar to her
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:5901:271"/> child, when she ſees him troubled with the wormes: ſo God taketh away his conſolations from vs, when we take ſome vaine ſelf-pleaſing in them, and are ſubiect to the worme of ouer-wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to ſelf-conceipt, and opinion of our owne good progreſſe in deuotion. <hi>O my God</hi> (ſayth the pſalmiſt) <hi>It is good for me that thou haſt humbled me.</hi> Yes in deed, it is verie profitable for me, <hi>for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was humbled, I did offend thee.</hi> 2. When we neglect to gather the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and deliciouſneſſe of the loue of God in due time: then in punishment of our ſlothfullneſſe, he abſenteth his delights from vs. The Iſraelites in the deſart that gathered not Manna earlie in the morning, could not find any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſunne-riſing, for then was it all melted with the heat of the ſunne. 3. We are alſo ſometimes layde in the bed of ſenſuall contentment, and tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie comforts, as the ſacred ſpouſe was in the Canticles, comes me the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome, and knocketh at the dore of our hart, and inſpireth vs to returne to our ſpirituall exerciſes: but we play the niggardly chapmen with him, for it
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:5901:272"/> angereth vs to leaue of our toyes, and to ſeparate our ſelues from our falſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. For this cauſe the true louer of our ſoules goeth his way from vs, and letteth vs lie as we liſt: but afterward when we would faine find him out, we haue much a doe to meet with him; and deſeruedlie, becauſe we were ſo vncour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and faithleſſe vnto his loue, as to refuſe to folow our exerciſe for his loue, and to chooſe to folow worldly vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Ah: then as yet thou haſt ſome of the branne of Egypt remaining: thou shalt then haue not a iot of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Manna. Bees deteſt all kind of artificiall odours: and the ſweetnes of the holy Ghoſt, cannot agree with the ſophiſticated delights of the world. 4. The double dealing, and ſlights which thou vſeſt in confeſſions, and ſpirituall communications with the conductour and maiſter of thy ſoule, many times is the cauſe of this drougth and barrenneſſe: for yf thou lie to the holy Ghoſt, no meruaile yf he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his conſolations from thee. Thou wilt not be ſimple, plaine, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout guile, as a litle child is: thou
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:5901:272"/> shalt not then enioy theſe ſpiritnall comfits, giuen only to Gods litle children. 5. Thou art filled and glutted with worldly contentments: no wonder then yf ſpirituall delights come not to thy table, or haue no good taſt in thy mouth: Doues allreadie filled (ſayth the ancient prouerb) do thinck cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries bitter. <hi>He which filled the hungrie with good things</hi> (ſayth our bleſſed Ladie) <hi>and ſent the rich away empty.</hi> They that be rich of wordly vanities, are not capable of ſpirituall treaſures. 6. Haſt thou conſerued well and carefully the fruicts of conſolations allreadie recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? then shalt thou receaue more ſtore againe: for to him that hath, more shaloe giuen: and he that hath not (negligently leeſing that which he receaued) euen that he hath shalbe taken away from him, he shalbe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of the fauours and graces, which were prepared for him, yf he had vſed well the former. The raine quickeneth them pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts that be greene, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them that be not green, it taketh away alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all likely hood of life &amp; growth, for it rotteth them wholly.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:5901:273"/>
               <p n="3">3. For manie ſuch cauſes doe we looſe comfort in deuotion, and fall into barrennes and drienes of ſpirit. Let vs then examin our conſcience, and ſee whether we can find in vs ſuch faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie cauſes as theſe. But note, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus, that this examination is not to be made with vnquietneſſe of mind; or ouermuch curioſitie, but after thou haſt faithfully conſidered thy going awrie in this reſpect, yf thou find the cauſe of the euil in thy ſelf, giue God thancks, for the harme is half healed, whoſe cauſe is diſcouered. Yf on the other ſide, thou find our no cauſe in particular, which may ſeeme vnto thee to haue occaſioned this deſolation, buſie not thy ſelf about anie more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſearche for it, but with all ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie, without examining any more particularities, doe this which I will tell thee.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Firſt of all humble thy ſelf reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently before the eyes of God, ackno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wledging thy miſerie, thy frailtie, the nothing that thou art in thy ſelf. Alas what am I, when I am left alone to mine owne prouidence? nothing els, O
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:5901:273"/> Lord, but a drie barren ground, that full of gappes and riftes, witneſſeth the drought it ſuffereth, for want of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly dewe: and the wind of tentation in the mean time doth diſſipate it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into fruictleſſe duſt. 2. Call vpon God and demaund of him his ſpirituall ioye. <hi>Render vnto me, O Lord, the ioy of thy ſaluatiou, My father, yf it be poſsible, lett this cuppe paſſe from mee.</hi> Gett thee away ô thou vnfruictfull Northe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, which drieſt vp the ſappe and iui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of my ſoule: and come ô proſperous winds of conſolations, and breath gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly ouer my poore garden, and then theſe good affections wil ſpread abroad the odour of their ſweetnes 3. Goe to thy Confeſſour, open thy hart vnto him, make him ſee cleerly all the plights and corners of thy ſoule: take his aduice ſimplie and humbly: for God that infinitly loueth obedience, maketh often times councells taken from other men, proue verie profitable, eſpecially giuen by conductours of ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, albeit otherwiſe there be no great likelyhood, that they should preuaile: as he made the waters of Iordan healthfull
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:5901:274"/> to Naaman, which Elizeus, without any appeerance at all of humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ordained him as a bath for his leproſie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All this being donne, nothing is ſo profitable, nothing ſo fruitfull in time of theſe ſpirituall deſolations, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reneſſe, as not to be ouermuch deſirous of being deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this aggreeuance or calamitie. I ſay not but that we may ſimplie and quietlie wishe to be eaſed of ſo great aburden: but my meaning is, that we should not too earneſtly affect this eaſe, and freedom from this deſolate ſtate of mind: but hartely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne our ſoule to the prouidence of God; that ſo long as it pleaſeth him, he may vſe our poore ſeruice, amid theſe troubleſome thornie-brakes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe deſerts. Let vs ſay to God at theſe times. <hi>O father, yf it be poſsible, lett this cup paſſe away from me:</hi> but lett vs with all from our verie harts, adioine the wordes folowinge of our bleſſed Saueour: <hi>Yet not my will be donne, but thine:</hi> vpon this good reſolution let vs reſt, and repoſe. For God ſeeing vs conſtantly perſeuer in this holy in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:5901:274"/> differency, will comfort vs with many graces, and fauours: as when he ſaw Abraham reſolued to depriue him ſelf of his ſonne Iſaac, he was contented with this his indifferency, &amp; pure reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forting him with a heauenly viſion, &amp; with moſt admirable benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. We muſt then in al kind of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as wel corporall as ſpirituall, in what ſoeuer diſtractions, or ſubtractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of ſenſible deuotion happening to vs, with great courage, and reſignation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſay: <hi>Our Lord gaue me conſolations, and our Lord hath taken them from me; his holy name be bleſsed.</hi> For perſiſting in this humilitie and ſubmiſſion, he will reſtore vnto vs his delicious fauours, as he did vnto Iob, who vſed the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd words conſtantly and vnfainedly in all his deſolations.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Finallie my Philotheus, amidſt all theſe ſterilities and deſolations, let vs not looſe courage, but expecting patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the returne of ſpiritual delights, keepe on our iourney, folow our exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of deuotion, multiplie good works and holy actions: and not being able to preſent to our ſpouſe, liquid
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:5901:275"/> conſerues, preſent him drie confitures: for all is one to him, prouided that the hart which offereth them, be perfectly reſolued to perſeuer loyallie in his loue. When the ſpring time is faire and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt, then do the Bees make more hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and fewer young impes: for the good wether fauouring them, they are ſo buſie in gathering the ſappe of ſweet flowers, that they forgett the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their young ones. But when the ſpringtime is troubleſome with gloomie cloudes and windie ſtormes, they gett more impes, and leſſe honnie for being not able to flie abroade to their gathering of honnie, they employ them ſelues to multiplie their race, and people their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealthe. So chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it oft times, my Philotheus, that the ſoule in the faire weather of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall comforts, buſieth her ſelf ſo much in gathering them together, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that heauenlie iuice out of them, that in the abundance of theſe daintie delights, she produceth fewer good wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes: and contrariwiſe amid the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of clowdie deſolations, ſeeing her ſelf deſtituted of thoſe ſpiritual delights
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:5901:275"/> of deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, she multiplieth ſolid works of edification ſo much more ſeriouſly, and aboundeth in fructifiyng of true virtues of patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, humilitie, abiection, reſignation, and abnegation, of all ſelf-will and ſelf loue.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is then a great abuſe and errour of manie, eſpeciallie of wemen, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that the ſeruice which we doe to God whithout this pleaſant taſt, &amp; ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible delight, &amp; tendernes of hart, is leſſe agreeable to his diuine maieſtie: for cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane contrarylie, our actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are like vnto roſes, which though being freshe and flourie they haue a better grace &amp; shew, yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are drie they haue a ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter odour: ſo though our works done with tendernes of deuotion be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to vs our ſelues, to vs I ſay, that conſider only our owne delight: yet when they are exerciſed by vs in time of drineſſe and barreneſſe of ſpirit, then haue they a goodlier eſtimation, and a better odour in the preſence of God. In time of deſolation, our will carieth vs (as it were by meer force) to the ſeruice of God, &amp; conſequently that will muſt needs be more vigorous and conſtant,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:5901:276"/> then the will which we haue of ſeruing God in time of comfort. It is no ſuch great matter to ſerue a prince in time of peace, and in the pompe and pleaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of the courte, but to ſerue him conſtantly in time of trouble and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and in warre, that is a true mark of conſtancy and loyaltie. Saint Angela de Fulgino ſayth, that of all prayers, that is moſt acceptable to God, which is made by force and meere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, that is, whereunto we applie our ſelues willinglie, not for any taſt or delight which we feele in it, nor by our owne inclination, but meerly, purely and onlie to pleaſe God: wherto our will driueth vs, as it were againſt our will, forcing and violently repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the drieneſſe, and contradictions, which oppoſe themſelues againſt it. The ſame ſay I of all ſorts of good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, that the more contradiction we find in exerciſing them, be it exteriour, or interiour, the more are they prized and eſteemed in the court of heauen. The leſſe of our owne particular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt that there is in the pourſnite of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, the more doth the puritie of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:5901:276" rendition="simple:additions"/> loue of God shine in it. A litle child wil eaſilie kiſſe his mother, when she giueth him honnie and ſugar, but it is a ſigne of greater loue, yf he kiſſe her after she hath giuen him wormeſeed, or bitter potions.</p>

               <head>The former diſcourſe is explained and confirmed by a notable example. CHAPTER 15.</head>
               <p n="1">1. TO make this inſtruction more euident and intelligible, I will recite an excellent peece of the hiſtorie of <hi>S.</hi> Bernard, in ſuch manner as I find it ſet downe in the learned and iudicious writer therof. He ſayth then in this wiſe. It is an ordinarie thing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt vnto all them that beginne to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue God, and are not yet experienced in the ſubtractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of grace, nor in ſpirituall viciſſitudes or entercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; deſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; that the taſt of ſenſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion &amp; that ſweet acceptable light of mind, (which maketh them haſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them ſelues in the waye of God) being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen from them: they preſently grow out of breath, and fall into puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and ſadnes of hart. They that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:5901:277"/> be of iudgement and vnderſtanding doe render this reaſon therof: that nature according to reaſon cannot long endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re (as a man might ſay) faſting, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie kind of delight or entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all, but needs muſt haue ſome contentment, either terreſtriall or cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall. But as ſoules lifted vp aboue them ſelues by taſt and trial of heauenly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, doe eaſilie renounce the delights of all ſenſible obiects: ſo when by Gods diſpoſition and ordinance that ſpirituall ioy is taken from them, finding them ſelues alſo on the other ſide depriued of corporall ſolace, and being not yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to expect with patience, the returne and riſing of the true ſunne of grace, it ſeemeth vnto them that they are no more in heauen or in earth, but that they be buried in perpetuall darknes: So that as litle children newlie weaned, hauing loſt their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers dugges they do languishe, and ſigh, and grow froward and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, principallie to their owne ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. This then happened in the voiage wherof we ſpeake, vnto one of the troupe, called Geoffrie of Peronne,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:5901:277"/> but newlie dedicated to the ſeruice of God. He being ſodainlie become drie in his deuotions, deſtituted of his woonted conſolations, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with a kind of inward darknes: began to call to memorie the world, his frinds, his parents, and the great meanes that but lately he had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him. By which memorie, he was aſſaulted with ſo cruell a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that not being able to hide it in his behaueour, one of his truſtie frinds perceaued it, and hauing found opportunitie, ioined himſelf to him, and asked him ſweetly in ſecret: what meaneth this change Geoffrie? How cometh it to paſſe, that contrarie to thy woont, thou art become ſo penſiue and afflicted. Ah my brother (anſwered Geoffrie with a deep ſigh) I shall neuer more be merrie ſo long as I liue. The other moued with compaſſion at theſe words, with a fraternall zeale, went and told all this to their common father Saint Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard: who perceauing the danger, went into a church there by, to pray to God for him, and Geoffrie in the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:5901:278"/> meane while ouerwhelmed with ſadnes, repoſing his head vpon a ſtone, fell faſt a ſleepe. But after a litle while, both of them aroſe, the one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prayer with his requeſt diſpatched in the high court of heauen, the other from ſleepe with ſo pleaſaunt and ſmiling a countenance, that his deer frind meruailing at ſo great &amp; ſodaine a chaunge, could not refraine from obiecting vnto him louingly that which a litle before he had anſwered him. Then Geoffrie replied: yf I told thee before that I should neuer in my life be ioyfull, now I aſſure thee, that I shall neuer in my life be ſorowfull.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This was the ſucceſſe of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that deuout perſonage, &amp; marke in it (my deer Philotheus) 1. Firſt that God ordinarilie giueth ſome fore-taſts of heauenly ioye, to ſuch as newlie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his ſeruice: ſo to draw them from earthlie pleaſures, and encourage the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the pourſuite of the loue of God: iuſt as a mother to intice &amp; allure her litle child to her breaſts, layeth honnie vpon her teats. 2. That notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the ſame good God, which according to the diſpoſition of his wiſdome, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:5901:278"/> from vs this milk and honny of conſolations: to the end that weaning his children in this manner, they might learne to eat the drie, but more ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall bread of liuely and ſound deuotion, exerciſed by the triall of diſtaſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. 3. That ſometimes verie vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment temptations ariſe amidſt theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate and drie diſcontentments of ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilitie of ſpirit: and then it behoueth vs to reſiſt theſe temptations co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantly, for they come not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God; but withall we muſt patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ſuffer this deſolate eſtate, of want of ſpirituall feeling in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions, for God hath ordeined &amp; diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it for our exerciſe and merit. 4. That we muſt not leeſe hart &amp; courage amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g theſe inward griefs, nor ſay as this good Geoffrie did, I shall neuer be ioyfull heerafter: for in the night ſeaſon, we muſt expect the daylights approache; Againe in the faireſt weather of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue we muſt not ſay now shall I neuer be ſad heerafter; No; for as the wiſe man ſayes, in time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, we muſt be mindfull of aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, and in our trauailes, hope for reſt: and as well in the one occaſion as in the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:5901:279"/> other, we muſt always humble our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. 5. That it is a ſoueraigne remedie to diſcouer our euel vnto ſome ſpiritual frind, that may be able to comfort vs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In fine for concluſion of this ſo neceſſarie aduertiſment, I note, that as in all other things, ſo in theſe drie ſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of our ſpirit, God and the deuil haue contrarie pretentions. For God would therby bring vs to puritie of hart, to a generall renunciatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our proper intereſt in his ſeruice, and to a perfect depoſing of our owne willes. But the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil goeth about by the ſame way to lead vs to puſillanimitie, to abate our coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, to make vs ſteppe a ſide to ſenſible paſſetimes, and at length to render vs yrkſome and loathſome to our ſelues, &amp; others that liue with vs; that ſo deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be diminished, and defamed. But yf thou obſerue diligently theſe leſſons which I haue giuen thee, thou shalt augment thy perfection in thoſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, which thou performeſt in time of theſe interiour afflictions: wherof one word more before I make an end.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sometimes theſe diſtaſts, this drouth and barrennes of ſpirit, doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:5901:279"/> from the indiſpoſitio of our bodie: as when through too much watching, labouring, faſting, one findeth him ſelf ouerloaden with weerineſſe, drouſines, heauines, &amp; ſuch like infirmities; which although they depend of the bodie, yet lett they not to hinder and trouble the ſpirit, by reaſon of the ſtraight bond with which they are tied one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In theſe occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, we muſt allwayes be mindfull, to produce many acts of virtue, with our ſpirit, or ſuperiour will: for although all our ſoule ſeeme to be ouer-layd with ſleepe and drouſines: yet the actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of our ſpirit eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that ſtate, are exceeding acceptable to God. And we may ſay in this caſe with the ſacred ſpouſe, <hi>I ſleep, but my hart watcheth.</hi> And as I ſayd before, though there be leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in this labour of ſpirit, yet is there more virtue and merit. The remedie in ſuch occurrences is, to eaſe the bodie with ſome kind of lawfull delight and recreation. So Saint Francis ordained that his religious should vſe ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in their labour, that the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of them, should not depreſſe and ouerthrow the ſpirit. And ſince we
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:5901:280"/> haue mentioned <hi>S.</hi> Francis, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his example, who was on a time him ſelf ſo vexed and tormented with a profound melancholie, that he could not chooſe but declare it in his behaueour. For yf he would conuerſe with his religious he knew not how; if he withdrew him ſelf, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, it went worſe with him; abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and mortification of his flesh, ouerwhelmed him: and prayer eaſed him not at all. And in this ſort remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this glorious father, the ſpace of two yeares, ſo that it ſeemed vnto him, that in a manner, God had forſaken him. But at length after he had ſo long and patiently ſuffered this rude and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement tentation, our Saueour in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reſtored to him the happie tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie and repoſe of his ſpirit. This haue I ſayd, to shew that the greateſt and faithfulleſt ſeruants of God, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto theſe aduerſities and afflictions of mind: and that therfore thoſe that are leſſer in Gods bookes, be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed yf ſome times they happen vnto them.</p>

The ſecond, to haue dedicated, and conſecrated thy ſoule, thy hart, and thy bodie, with all that thou haſt, to the loue and ſeruice of God: The third; that yf it should happen vnto thee to fall into ſome naughtie action, that thou wilt procure immediatlie to riſe

               <p n="2">2. Conſider to whome thou haſt made this proteſtation: euen to God him ſelf. Yf according to reaſon, our word giuen to a man, doe ſtraightly oblige &amp; bind vs, how much more our word and promiſe giuen and paſſed to allmightie God? <hi>Ah Lord</hi> (ſayd Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid) <hi>it is to thee that my hart hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced this good word, and I will not forgett it.</hi>

The holie Virgin, bleſſed Saint Ioſeph, thy good Angel, Saint Lewis, all this bleſſed companie beheld thee, and ſighed with ſighes of ioy and contentment at thy words, and looked vpon thee with eyes of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable loue, when thy hart pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:5901:283"/> holie purpoſes. It was in the flower of thine age. Ah what a felicitie is it to learne quickly, that which we cannot know but ouer-late. Saint Auguſtin, hauing been called to God at thirtie yeares of his age, cried out: <hi>O ancient beauty, how is it, that I knew thee ſo late? Alas I ſaw thee before, but I did not conſider thee till now.</hi> And thou maiſt well ſay: O ancient ſweetnes, why did not I taſt thee ſooner? And yet alas, thou deſeruedſt it not at that time in which it was giuen thee: therfore acknowledging the great bountie and grace of God, for calling thee to him in thy youthe, ſay vnto him with Dauid: <hi>Thou haſt lightened me, ô God, and touched me from my youth, and I will for euer pronounce thy mercy.</hi> But yf this thy vocation was in thy older dayes, ô then, Philotheus, how ineſtimable a benefit was it, after thou hadſt in ſuch ſort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed the yeares of thy life paſt, that God of his goodnes ſhould call thee before thy death, and ſtay the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of thy miſerie, euen at that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, in which yf it had beene conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, thou hadſt beene miſerable for euer and euer!</p>

And in a word to haue ſo often frequented the holy Communion (more then thou wouldſt once haue done) ſo vniting thy ſelf to this ſoueraigne well-ſpring of euer-during graces? Ah, theſe be great and ineſtimable fauours. We muſt way and ponder them with the wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtes of the ſanctuarie: it is Gods right hand that hath done all this. <hi>The right hand of God</hi> (ſayth Dauid) <hi>hath done powerfully, his right hand hath extolled me: I will not dy, but liue; and will make knowne with hart, word, and deed, the wonders of his goodnes.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Thy ſoule hath alſo a free-will, of a moſt noble excellencie, which is able to loue God, and cannot hate him, conſidered in him ſelfe.

In liberalitie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to couetouſneſſe &amp; nigardize? in charitie compared with enuie? in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie, in reſpect of intemperancie? vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues haue this excellencie, that they fill the ſoule with an inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable ſweetnes and delight, after she hath practized them: wheras vices leaue the ſoule ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedinglie weeried, tyred, and moleſted. And why endeuour we not then to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine theſe pleaſures, that haue no gall nor bitternes mingled with them?</p>
               <p n="2">2. He that hath but a few vices, is not content with the delights which they bring him: and he that hath manie, is malconte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with the cumber of them. He that hath but a few virtues, hath a great deale of content in them: and the more his contentment is, the more his virtues increaſe.</p>

CONSIDER the examples of the ſaincts of all ſorts &amp; orders: what is it that they haue not done and ſuffered, to loue God, and be whollie deuoted and addicted to his ſeruice? Look vpon the inuincible martyrs in their conſtant reſolutions, what torments haue they not ſuffered for the maintenance and performance of their holy purpoſes? But aboue all

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:5901:303"/> ſet downe in the firſt part at the end of the meditations: and proteſt at all times to haue a will &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to keep euery point of it, ſaying with Dauid: <hi>No my God, neuer will I forget thy iuſtification, for in them thou haſt giuen mee life.</hi> And when thou findſt any ſpirituall battail in thy ſoule, take in hand the ſelf ſame proteſtation, and proſtrate in ſpirit with all humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, pronounce it all from thy hart, and thou shalt find great eaſe in thy conflict.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Profeſſe to all the world, that thou deſireſt to be deuout, be not ashamed of that holy deſire and profeſſion. I ſay, make profeſſion of a true deſire of deuotion, and not, make profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of deuotion: blush not to vſe thoſe common and ordinarie actions, which helpe vs to obtaine the loue of God: aduow and admitt hardyly, that thou doeſt thy endeuour to meditate, and thou hadſt rather dye then ſinne mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally. That thou wilt by Gods grace, frequent the ſacraments, and folow the counſels of thy ghoſtly father (though for good conſiderations it be not
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:5901:303"/> expedient to name him). For this franck and free confeſſion of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, that wee are with a ſpeciall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction conſecrated and addicted to his loue: is moſt acceptable to the diuine maieſtie, who by no meanes alloweth his ſeruants, to be ashamed of his croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe. Beſides, this open profeſſion, cuts of manie a ſummon, manie an intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the world would make to the contrarie: and bidds vs to ſtand vpon our reputation, in the conſtant pourſuite of deuotion. The philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, openly profeſſed them ſelues to be philoſophers, that ſo me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt them to liue Philoſophicallie: and we muſt make our ſelues knowne to be louers of deuotion and holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, that men may lett vs liue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly. Yf any man tell thee, that one may liue deuoutly without the practize of theſe exerciſes and aduices: denie it him not, but anſwer him louingly, that thy weaknes is ſo great, that thou ſtandeſt in much more need of helpe, then other men doe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſt of all, I coniure and entreat thee, my deere Philotheus, by all that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:5901:304"/> which is holie in heauen and earth, by the baptiſme which thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, by the ſweet milk of mercie which thou haſt ſucked from the breſts of our Lord Ieſus, by the moſt louing hart, in which thou placeſt all thy hope and confidence: Continue and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuer in this happie enterprize of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life. Our dayes runn on a pace, death is hand at our gate, <hi>The trompett ſoundeth the retreat</hi> (ſayth Saint Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie Nazianzen) <hi>lett euery man be reade, for the iudge is at hand.</hi> Saint Symphorians mother ſeing him ledd to martyrdom, cried after him: my ſonne, my ſonne, remember euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life, look vp to heauen, and thinck vpon him that raignes there, a short end will quickly end the courſe of this life. I ſay the ſame to thee (my Philotheus) look vp to heauen, and leaue it not for this baſe earth; thinck vpon hell, and caſt not thy ſelf into that dreadfull gulfe for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of pleaſures; remember Ieſus Chriſt, denie him not for the worlde: and though the labour of a deuout life, ſeeme hard vnto thee, ſing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:5901:304"/> with Saint Frauncis:
<q>
                     <l>Since heauen is for my paines aſsignd'</l>
                     <l>Paines are ſweet paſſetimes to my mind.</l>
                  </q> Liue for euer ſweet Ieſus, to whome wtih the Father, and holy Ghoſt, be all honour and glorie, now and alway, and for euer and euer. Amen.</p>

            <head>THE COMMVNICATION OF DOCTOVR THAVLERVS with a poore beggar, wherein is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the example of a perfect man, and how we should reſigne our ſelues in all thinges vnto the good pleaſure of God.</head>
            <p>THERE was on a tyme a great diuine, who prayed vnto God the ſpace of 8. yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, that it might be his good pleaſure, to direct him to a man, that might inſtruct and teach him the true way of vertu. And it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened beinge in this deſyer, that he heard a voice from heauen, which ſayd vnto him, goe vnto ſuch a Church portch, and there thou shalt finde a man that wil inſtruct thee in the ſpiritual life. He walking then towards the ſayd Church, founde a poore begger, who had his feete filthye and foule, and al naked, whoſe clothes were not worth a halfe penny; and he ſaluted him in this ſort: God giue you good morrow,
<pb facs="tcp:5901:310"/> my frind. The poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anſwered him, Sir, I do not remember that euer I had an euil morow. The Doctour ſayd vnto him; God giue you a good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye life: wherfore ſaye you that? quothe the begger vnto him; for I was neuer vnhappie. Which the Doctor not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, ſayd vnto him againe; God bleſſe you my frinde, I pray you ſpeake a littel more clearlye, for I know not what you meane. Then the poore beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar anſwered him; Good maſter Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour, I shall doe it willinglye: you know you badde mee good morrow, wher vnto I replyed, that I had neuer any ill morrow, for when I haue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I prayſe God: if it freeſe, haile, ſnow, rayne, be it fayre or foule, I giue prayſe to God; though I be poore, miſerable, and deſpiſed of each on, I giue thankes vnto God. And therfore I neuer had any euil morow: you did wiſh vnto mee alſo, a good and happy life; wher vnto I made you anſwere, that I was neuer vnfortunate, becauſe I haue learnt alwayes to reſigne my ſelfe vnto the wil of God being certaine that al his workes cannot be but very good: by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

If God would damne mee, ſayd the poore man, verely if he would vſe mee ſo hardlye, I haue two armes to imbrace him; the one whereof is a profounde humilitye, by the which I am vnited vnto his holy humanitye: the other is loue, and charitye, which ioyneth mee vnto his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
